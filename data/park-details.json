The park protects important habitat for resident Grey Whales during the summer and second growth forest on the upland. Allison Harbour is a protected, short inlet comprised of small coves with tidal flats at the head. This is a protected transitional stop for boaters and is used as a safe anchorage from frequent southeasterly winds. The harbour is the last all-weather anchorage for boaters travelling north around Cape Caution; thus, it is an important addition to the network of boat havens along the British Columbia coast.",

There are several archeological sites and cultural sites within the park. It was gold that gave Atlin its reason for existence. Hordes of prospectors poured into Alaska and the Yukon during 1898 spurred by a number of rich strikes. Many of these became weary of travel and were lured aside to discoveries that were easier to reach. The gold rush came to Atlin Lake country in 1898 and was one of the richest offshoots of the klondike rush. By the end of the mining season of 1899 about 5000 people flocked to the region, and Atlin was a busy and important town. Although creeks in the present day park must have been prospected, none bore any gold. Although production was greatest in the early years, the Atlin field still produces today.

In the 1940s, Bear Glacier began to retreat and Strohn Lake formed in the exposed basin. Acting as an ice dam, the glacier prevented the lake from draining down the Bear River Valley. If enough water collects behind an ice dam, a glacier may begin to float. Water flowing under the ice quickly creates a large tunnel. The lake empties, the ice dam resettles, and water again begins to collect until another flood is triggered. Five times between 1958 and 1962 Strohn Lake emptied underneath its ice dam in a catastrophic tumult of muddy water, rock and ice. This type of flood is known by the Icelandic term “jokulhlaup.” In 1967, Bear Glacier melted away from the valley wall and Strohn Lake was no longer dammed. The threat of sudden destructive icy floods in the Bear River Valley disappeared with the glacier’s retreat.

Two routes link to trails into the park. They follow logging roads, so watch for industrial traffic and use headlights. Roads become very slippery when wet: four-wheel drive, shovel and tire chains are recommended.\n</p>\n<h4>\n  Southern route\n</h4>\n<p>\n  To access hiking and horse trails at Relay Creek and Tyaughton Creek: drive approximately 69km on Carpenter Lake Road west of Lillooet.

      "description": "<div>\n  Bowron Lake, photo by Brittany Cleminson\n</div>\n<p>\n  Bowron Lake Provincial Park is a large wilderness area situated on the western slopes of the Cariboo Mountain Range. The world-renowned\n  <a href=\"#Canoeing\">\n    Bowron Lake Canoe Circuit</a>\n  encompasses a 116 km chain of lakes, waterways and connecting portages. This wilderness canoe trip takes from 6 to 10 days to complete, depending on your time frame and skill level. For those looking for a shorter trip, the west side of the circuit can be paddled in 2 to 4 days. It is recommended that those who attempt the circuit have some wilderness canoeing experience.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The park has tremendous diversity in topography and vegetation. The rounded hilltops of the Quesnel Highlands on the west side of the circuit have a unique character quite different from the imposing Cariboo Mountains on the eastern and southern sections of the circuit. The park is a place of many moods, from bright sunshine and placid blue lakes to angry gray waters and torrential rains.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Bowron Lake Park also has a very pleasant 25 unit drive-in campground. The campground is located near the Registration Centre a short distance from Bowron Lake itself. There are also a few short walking trails nearby.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Increased park visitation during recent years has placed a great deal of pressure on the park’s resources.

A multitude of islands provides park visitors sheltered waters and anchorages with a backdrop of the magnificent coastal mountains to the east and the waters of Queen Charlotte Strait to the west. These islands have been utilized by First Nation peoples for generations and there is ample evidence of their extensive use of the area. Kayakers and boaters can easily “discover” white midden beaches, culturally modified trees, clam “terraces” and even a petroglyph while exploring the park.\n</p>\n<p>\n  This park is extremely popular with sea kayakers from around the world. Most kayakers prefer the southern portion of the park, though increasing numbers are starting to discover the beauty of the northern islands and their protected waterways.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Please remember to practice “<a href=\"https://leavenotrace.ca/\">\n    Leave No Trace</a>” ethics when visiting this park.\n  <br>\n</p>",

Other species known to use the area include black bear, moose, wolverine, and deer. Burnie Lakes support a diverse fish population including kokanee and mountain whitefish.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The park also protects whitebark pine communities. Whitebark pine communities are regionally significant because they are at the most northerly extent of their range. Whitebark pine are declining throughout their range due to mountain pine beetle and white pine blister rust. Clark’s Nutcrackers are dependent on whitebark pine seeds for survival.

Rocky promontories, salt marshes and jagged headlands punctuate the fine-textured, white-sand beaches. The most impressive of these beaches, Nels Bight, stretches more than 2,400 metres long and 210 metres wide at low tide, and is one of the park’s most popular camping destinations. Other significant beaches include San Josef Bay, Guise Bay, Experiment Bight, Lowrie Bay and Nissen Bight.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Visitors can choose between a day hike or a backpacking excursion to explore the sandy beaches, rainforests, and lowland bogs and muskeg of this wilderness park.\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"hiking\">\n      Hiking trails in Cape Scott Provincial Park</a>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  <strong>Special Features:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n  Cape Scott Provincial Park is home to sea stacks, which visitors can access at low tide. The eastern portion of the park contains a number of estuaries that are accessible only by boat. Cape Scott is also fortunate to have some excellent examples of old-growth forest, including Sitka Spruce in excess of 3 metres in diameter, and Western Red Cedar of similar sizes. Examples of these trees can be found throughout the park, including on the easy hike to San Josef Beach. About 20 minutes north of the Eric Lake campsite is a Sitka Spruce that measures more than 7 metres in circumference. This is a popular spot for hikers to stop and absorb their surroundings, as well as take photographs.\n</p>\n<h4>Cape Scott Lighthouse</h4>\n<p>\n  The lighthouse and the cape\n  <strong>are outside</strong>\n  the provincial park boundary and are private property belonging to the Department of National Defence. The old trail and foghorn were built during World War 2 by DND staff to give access to the beach etc. but as the old structures, boardwalk and suspension bridges deteriorated, they became dangerous and were removed by the federal government. BC Parks is not responsible for this trail and not allowed to trespass on this private property.\n</p>\n<h4>Tourist Facilities and Information</h4>\n<p>\n  Even though Cape Scott is a wilderness park, a variety of tourist facilities are located nearby in Port Hardy, Port McNeill, Holberg and Port Alice.

      "description": "<p>\n  Carmanah Walbran Provincial Park is a luxuriously forested sanctuary that is without a doubt one of the most remarkable wild places on Vancouver Island. The lower Carmanah Valley was declared a provincial park in 1990, and the Walbran and upper Carmanah Valleys were added in 1995. The park offers protection to diverse forest ecosystems, including a large Sitka spruce ecosystem that represents 2% of BC’s remaining old-growth forest.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Carmanah Walbran is home to some of the world’s largest spruce trees, some reaching heights in excess of 95 metres and living for 800 years or more. The park is also home to ancient, gnarled cedars – estimated to be well over 1,000 years old – clinging to the side hills. Nestled beneath these awe-inspiring trees is a diverse variety of flora and fauna possible only in an ecosystem that has remained undisturbed for hundreds of years.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The recent addition of the Walbran and upper Carmanah Valleys completes the protection of the Carmanah Creek watershed and the southern portion of the Walbran Creek watershed. The park provides unique opportunities for forest research and education in the areas of biodiversity, wildlife and fisheries habitat. It is a majestic forest capable of inspiring all visitors who come here, and offers unforgettable recreational opportunities for hikers and wilderness lovers.\n</p>\n<p>\n  This coastal fringe of mainly Sitka spruce, with its associated plants and animals, is truly a special place to discover. Sitka spruce forests are typically coast-hugging – they are rarely found more than 80 kilometres inland and at elevations greater than 30 metres. The park’s extensive groves of spruce attain a biomass (weight of plants per hectare) that is nearly twice that of a tropical forest. This dynamic system has developed over thousands of years and functions perfectly if left undisturbed.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Several hiking trails in the Carmanah Valley provide access to many of the park’s notable natural features, including some of the area’s largest trees. Many sections of the trail are extremely muddy and difficult. Be equipped with appropriate clothing (including adequate rain gear) and good hiking boots.\n  <br>\n</p>",

      "safetyInfo": "<h4>Park Safety\n</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Carmanah Walbran is remote and rugged. Access to the park is via private logging roads. Great care must be exercised while traveling these roads as they are at times narrow, bumpy, and used frequently by industrial logging trucks. Always drive with your headlights on as visibility may be limited due to dust and adverse weather.\n    <strong>Logging trucks have the right of way at all times</strong>; other users are expected to pull off onto the nearest shoulders when encountering a truck.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Visitors should make the trip in an appropriate vehicle with adequate clearance for bumpy terrain; at least one spare tire should be carried.

One of these men, Henry Cody, discovered the Cody Caves. Later, in 1899, the caves were the subject of a short story written by Roger Pocock for “Argosy” magazine entitled “The Noble Five”. This story described a cave whose inner chambers were walled with gold ore. The caves then grew in popularity and were visited by many locals and curious individuals including, in 1908, the governor General of Canada, Earl Grey. Though they are not walled with gold, the caves do contain an impressive display of calcite formations that can be seen in many areas of the approximately 800 metres of explorable passage. These formations are extremely old and have been growing at an average rate of about one cubic centimetre a century. The cave itself began formation when limestone beds laid down almost 600 million years ago were thrust upward by mountain building forces that occurred around 170 million years ago. Although the Cody Caves are almost unimaginably old and carved from solid rock, they are exceptionally fragile and can be irreparably damaged in seconds. In fact the caves have probably experienced more change in the 90 years since their discovery than in the previous 9,000.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Conservation:</strong>\n    Only guided cave tours for visitors’ safety and for protection of the cave’s features.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"/plan-your-trip/visit-responsibly/wildlife-safety\">\n      General Wildlife, Marine &amp; Outdoor Ethics Information</a>\n  </li>\n</ul>",

The railway was built over three mountain ranges. In the Coquihalla Gorge – the river cut a 300 foot deep channel of solid granite. A straight line of tunnels were built through it which are known now as the Othello Tunnels. There are spectacular viewing opportunities available on the trail, through the tunnels and on the bridges. This park highlights the Kettle Valley Railway grade that passes through the canyon and 5 tunnels which were built in 1914.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It contains a 135 hectare land base. It is a popular tourist attraction for the town of Hope and provides viewing, walking, fishing and picnicking opportunities. The hiking trail links to the historic Hope-Nicola Cattle Trail. The engineer Andrew McCullough was an avid reader of Shakespearean literature, and used characters such as Lear, Jessica, Portia, Iago, Romeo and Juliet to name stations of the Coquihalla subdivision.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Please note:\n  </strong>Services are available from\n  <strong>April 1 to October 31</strong>.

Logging activities prior to the establishment of the park have opened much of the forest floor to the luxuriant growth of vine maple and cedar. Between 800 m and 940 m elevation, the forest gradually changes and, as the ridge tops are approached at 1,300 m above sea level, mountain hemlock, amabalis fir and yellow cypress, for which the park is named, predominate. The lush understory consists largely of shade-tolerant ferns, huckleberries, red and white heather, and false azaleas.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Invasive plants occur in the park and are being managed by BC Parks and partners.

      "natureAndCulture": "<h5>\n  History\n</h5>\n<p>\n  Established in 1941 the park was named in memory of Ernest C. Manning, Chief Forester of British Columbia from 1936 - 1941. Mr. Manning was killed in an airplane accident in 1941. During his time as Chief Forester he was very instrumental in developing the idea of setting land aside for future generations to enjoy.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Prior to the park, as we know it today, being established the Three Brothers Preserve was established in 1931 to save the alpine meadows from overgrazing by sheep. This was a 6,440 hectare area which is part of what we now know as Sub-Alpine Meadow. The preserve was doubled in size in 1936 and the Three Brothers Wildlife Reserve was formed. Since 1941 when the Class “A” Provincial Park was established there have been several revisions to the boundaries. The most recent was in October 1999 increasing the size to 70,844 hectares.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In 1949 the Hope Princeton Hwy was completed that made the park accessible to motor vehicles and in 1957 Manning Park boasted construction of the first nature house in the province.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The park is home to a great deal of history both natural and human. For those interested, a very informative “Natural and Human History Interpretive Theme Document for Manning Provincial Park” was written in 1989 and published by Arenaria Research and Interpretation. The document was not published for resale but might be available at local libraries. A reference copy is available at the Visitor Centre.\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <em>\n    Ernest C. Manning 1890-1941:\n  </em>\n  <br>\n  <em>\n    “One of&nbsp; British Columbia’s great public servants died Thursday in the Northern Ontario plane crash. There was no man to whom the people of this province owed a greater debt for self-sacrificing service than to Ernest C. Manning. His job was chief forester for this adopted province. It was indeed his mission in life. He was our ablest exponent of outdoors beauty and outdoors wealth...”\n  </em>\n  <br>\n  <em>\n    The safe establishment and perpetuation of our timber resources was the chief end and ambition of his career. No civil servant in this part of the world ever gave himself more completely to his job, or more intelligently.\n  </em>\n</blockquote>\n<h5>\n  Cultural Heritage\n</h5>\n<p>\n  Historic trails in the park include the Dewdney Trail, Hope Pass, Whatcom Trail, Engineers Road, Skyline Trail and the provincially significant Blackeye’s Trail. Historic features include the remains of ranches, trapping cabins, mining shafts, Buckhorn mining camp and historic fire lookout buildings at Windy Joe and Monument 83.\n</p>\n<h5>\n  Conservation\n</h5>\n<p>\n  E. C. Manning Provincial Park, together with the\n  <a href=\"../skagit/\" class=\"legacy-link\">\n    Skagit Valley Provincial Park</a>\n  to the east and the\n  <a href=\"../cascade/\" class=\"legacy-link\">\n    Cascade Recreation Area</a>\n  to the north, for a significant continuous Protected Area unit in the southern interior of British Columbia. Bordered to the south by the North Cascades National Park in Washington, U.S.A., Manning is at the centre of a major tract of protected lands that are of international significance.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In addition to its widely popular recreational values, Manning features particular ecological values, due in part to its location at the transition between the wet coastal ranges and the dry interior plateau.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The geography and ecology of E.C. Manning Provincial Park is as varied as it is dramatic. Ranging from the wet coastal mountains, to jagged snow-capped peaks, alpine meadows filled with wildflowers in the early summer, to the chain of small lakes or broad, flowing river beds along the valley floors.\n</p>\n<p>\n  E. C. Manning Provincial Park is characterized by a wide diversity of plants, animals, soils and landforms. Many rare and endangered species depend upon the large areas of protected habitat within the park. E. C. Manning’s role continues to be that of one of British Columbia’s major recreation and tourism destinations, but equally importantly, an important protected area for the conservation of British Columbia’s unique natural heritage.\n</p>\n<h5>\n  Wildlife\n</h5>\n<p>\n  E. C. Manning Provincial Park is home to a wide variety of birds and animals. There are 206 separate species of birds and 63 species of mammals within the park. Many of these are quite common species, such as the Columbian ground squirrel and the common pika, but also found in Manning are the less common mountain beaver, wolverine and the Cascade golden-mantled ground squirrel. E. C. Manning Provincial Park and the Cascade Recreation Area are also central to efforts to recover the threatened grizzly bear population of the North Cascades, forming part of the core habitat area for the conservation of this small but significant population.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The spotted owl is at risk in British Columbia, because much of its preferred habitat has been adversely affected by logging or lost due to land development. These rare birds are known to occur within E. C. Manning Park and a management plan to conserve spotted owl in the Manning and Skagit Valley areas is underway.</p>",

The Cavanagh Creek Road enters from Pear Lake, and is extremely rough, providing only limited motorized access to the height of land. There is no public motorized access beyond this point. ATV, motorcycle, and snowmobile use is prohibited on this road and beyond, except under permit.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Off-road driving in any type of motor vehicle is prohibited at Edge Hills Park.

As spring progresses, lakes in the area – many of which have been stocked – ripple with rainbow, cutthroat and dolly varden trout. During late spring and through the summer, fishermen head to the tidal waters to fish for chinook or coho salmon.\n</p>\n<p>\n  After a morning of fishing, pack a picnic lunch and take a cool stroll to the Elk Falls day-use area. Just 3 km from the campground, this picnic area contains easy walking trails and the plunging 25-metre waterfall that gives this park its name. Hiking trails also lead to other areas in the park, which is home to the only significant stand of old-growth Douglas fir north of MacMillan Provincial Park.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The large campground at Elk Falls Provincial Park provides a convenient base camp for day tripping.

      "locationNotes": "<p>\n  Elk Lakes Provincial Park is located in southeastern BC, about 104 kilometres north of Sparwood. Turn off Highway 3 at Sparwood and go north on Highway 43 until you reach the community of Elkford, a distance of 35 kilometres. From here, travel the gravel road on the west side of the Elk River. Approximately 47 kilometres north of Elkford the road crosses the Elk River and joins the Kananaskis Power Line Road. It is 5.8 kilometres from the crossing to the Cadorna Creek trailhead; the Elk Lakes trailhead is a further 16.1 kilometres.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Driving time from Sparwood to the park is approximately two hours. Access to the park is also possible from Alberta’s adjoining Peter Lougheed Provincial Park.

At lower elevations alpine fir, Engleman spruce and lodgepole pine predominate, interspersed with juniper, twinberry, false azalea, white rhododendron, and buffalo berry. Yellow violets, foam flowers and bunchberries add a touch of colour. The meadows are alive with scrub birch, cinque foil, Saskatoon berry and gooseberry, while alpine flowers such as fireweed, castilleja, blue violet, elephant’s head and giant ragwort splash the area with vivid displays of colour. Flowers, trees, and shrubs are part of the park’s natural heritage, please do not damage or remove them. The area surrounding the Elk Lakes is a mature old growth forest and includes dead snags that provide excellent habitat for cavity dwelling birds and small mammals.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Wildlife:</strong>\n    The wildlife at lower elevations includes scores of red squirrels and snowshoe hares. Beavers reside near the Elk Lakes and upper reaches of Cadorna Creek. Elk, white-tailed deer, and moose frequent the meadows throughout the park. Occasionally a mountain goat, Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep, grizzly bear or black bear may be seen by the observant visitor. Birdlife is common in the area. While hiking or sitting quietly, one might see spruce grouse, wrens, juncos, snipe, flickers, or the Clark’s nutcracker. A variety of waterfowl is transient in the lake areas, as are osprey and blue herons.\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"/plan-your-trip/visit-responsibly/wildlife-safety\">\n          General Wildlife, Marine &amp; Outdoor Ethics Information</a>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>",

When it became evident that the gold was not available in the amounts estimated, the miners started moving north on the Fraser River. A few Chinese remained in the area. The area came into the hands of a man named Walker, who felt Emory Creek would become the head of riverboat navigation on the Fraser. Eventually, he sold the land to the Oppenheimer Brothers in early 1879. In the fall of 1879, Emory was chosen by the C.P.R. as the western terminus. In a short time it became Emory Creek. The town consisted of thirteen streets with its own newspaper, various shops, a brewery, nine saloons and a sawmill. When Yale was made the terminus, Emory was all but abandoned by 1885, with the completion of the railway. Today, it is an easily accessible treed campground with paved roads and flush outhouses.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"/plan-your-trip/visit-responsibly/wildlife-safety\">\n      General Wildlife, Marine &amp; Outdoor Ethics Information</a>\n  </li>\n</ul>",

From the delta area to a forested area made up of ridges and deep slopes, this park offers two dramatically different topographical areas. There is over 2 km of waterfront with surrounding mountains and deep canyons. Shorts Creek passes through a deep canyon creating a series of waterfalls and deep pools. With almost two kilometres of waterfront property, the park has opportunities for camping, swimming, fishing, canoeing, kayaking, hiking and wildlife viewing. Recreational users can enjoy the natural sand beach while wildlife viewers can hike the Canyon trail and view a variety of birds, small mammals, deer and bighorn sheep in the higher regions.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Historical features throughout the park include the Manor House, the octagonal barn and several other farm buildings. A small wetland area located south of the Packing House, a portion of lakeshore and the Shorts Creek corridor and canyon below Westside Road are designated Special Feature-Natural Conservation Areas. Notable features within the zone include a large eagle’s nest, old growth cottonwoods and several wildlife trees, Shorts Creek waterfall and kokanee spawning grounds. The Fintry Manor House, garden, the barns, remnant power generation and irrigation systems are special heritage features.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Fintry Protected Area was established on April 18, 2001, to enhance the ecological viability of the existing park. This protected area protects important California bighorn sheep habitat and provides increased representation of the North Okanagan Basin ecosection by capturing an increased elevational gradient as well as providing a spectacular canyon and hiking and viewing opportunities.\n</p>",

      "natureAndCulture": "<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>History:</strong>\n    Foch-Gilttoyees was designated as a Class A provincial Park on May 20, 2004 following recommendations from the Kalum Land and Resource Management Plan. The protected area portion was designated a year later on March 22, 2005. Drum Lummon Mines and Paisley Point Mines established mineral claims north of Drumlummon Bay in the early 1920’s for extraction of copper, gold and silver. Some mineral claims still exist in this area (adjacent to the north side of the protected area) but are excluded from the park.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong>\n    Foch-Gilttoyees contains part of a historical First Nations travel route between the Douglas Channel and the Skeena River (the remainder of the route is in Gitnadoiks River Park).\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Conservation:</strong>\n    Foch Lagoon is one of the largest and most remote lagoons on the BC coast. It includes a highly productive and unique tidal narrows at its entranceway. Because of the heavy tide influence in the narrows the oceanic productivity in this area is very high compared to the rest of the Douglas Channel. The kelp beds that are found in this area support nurseries for a wide array of sea life.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Wildlife:</strong>\n    Foch-Gilttoyees protects a regionally significant estuary complex at the north end of the Gilttoyees Inlet. The Gilttoyees Creek and Peechugh Creek estuary is notable for its well-developed inter-tidal flats and relatively under-developed mud flats. Salt-water marsh and meadow communities dominate the inter-tidal flats. The estuary has very high wildlife values, particularly over-wintering habitat for the Blue-listed Trumpeter Swan, Barrow’s Goldeneye, Harlequin Duck, Surf Scoter, Long-tailed duck and Western Grebe.\n  </li>\n</ul>",

In more recent years, the river was used as a route for transportation of people and resources. Fort George Canyon was one of the few obstacles along the river in north central British Columbia.

Imagine falling though the ice in the Northwest Territories, losing all the toes off one foot and the heel off the other to frostbite, thanking Indigenous knowledge that you did not lose more! Imagine not stopping there, traveling by boat and canoe down the Bulkley Valley to Vancouver and then paddling around Vancouver Island to find your future home. It took pioneer James French two adventurous years to travel from New Brunswick to Victoria. He pre-empted the land west of Sooke in 1885. French was an early naturalist, traveling the world to bring exotic animals to zoos for public enjoyment and education. After an expedition to Africa, French once brought home a small elephant, before selling it to the Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle. French died in 1952, survived by his family who continued to live on the property and play an active part in local logging. French had hoped that a much larger section of the west coast of Vancouver Island would be made into a provincial park. His home and favourite beach would become French Beach Provincial Park in 1974 - 20 years later, Juan de Fuca Provincial Park would further his dream.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong>\n    French Beach lies within the traditional territory of the T’Sou-ke First Nation. Their economy was based on hunting, fishing and gathering, and extended families among the Straits people owned the lands and resources, which could not be sold, only inherited.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Conservation:</strong>\n    Beautiful hiking trails lead you through second growth forest of Douglas fir, Sitka spruce, western hemlock and Western red cedar to the sand and pebble beach. You will also find salal, Oregon grape, evergreen huckleberries and a large variety of ferns along the trails.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Wildlife:</strong>\n    Once on the beach, there are excellent whale-watching opportunities, particularly for Gray whales. These magnificent creatures migrate to northern feeding grounds in the spring and return south in the fall. Killer whales, otters, seals and sea lions can also be seen offshore. French Beach is also a great place to observe seabirds, Bald eagles and ospreys. A number of other animals can be found in the park, including frogs, salamanders and small mammals such as minks, squirrels and raccoons. Black bears and cougars make their homes in the surrounding areas and may move through the park, especially during warmer months.\n  </li>\n</ul>",

      "natureAndCulture": "<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>History:</strong>\n    In 1860, while carrying out a survey of Howe Sound on board the Royal Navy survey ship H.M.S. Plumper, Captain George Henry was impressed by a towering mountain dominating the view to the northeast. Captain Richards chose to name the 2,678 metre mountain Mount Garibaldi, after the great 19th century Italian patriot and soldier, Giuseppe Garibaldi, a guerrilla general whose exploits and valour were held in high esteem. In 1907, a party of six Vancouver climbers reached the summit of Mount Garibaldi. The views from the peak inspired the establishment of summer climbing camps at Garibaldi Lake. This early interest led to the creation in 1920 of a park reserve. Garibaldi Provincial Park was legislated as a Class A park in 1927, a 195,000 hectare mountain wilderness just 64 kilometres north of Vancouver.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Conservation:</strong>\n    During July and August the alpine areas of Garibaldi Provincial Park offer hikers an opportunity to view alpine flowers in bloom, a beautiful display of nature. Please keep to designated trails. Shortcutting trails destroys plant life and soil structure in fragile alpine meadows. Trail erosion by rain and melting snow occurs rapidly as a result. BC Parks asks for your cooperation as we help to repair damaged areas. Please help by obeying posted signs.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Wildlife:</strong>\n    Small mammals and birds such as squirrels, chipmunks, grey jays, and flickers can often be seen. Large mammals such as mountain goats, deer, cougars, wolverines, grizzly and black bears, also call the park home, although are seen less frequently.\n  </li>\n</ul>",

The first reference to a Portage in the vicinity of what would later be known as the Giscome Portage is found in the journals of Simon Fraser (1806). The gold strikes on Germansen and Manson Creeks led to the Omineca Gold Rush in the late 1860s. In 1863, a guide from the Lheidli T’enneh lead two Black miners across the trail, John Robert Giscome of Jamaica and Henry McDame from the Bahamas. These two men originally came to North America for the California Gold Rush, but arriving near the end of the rush they headed to the gold fields of the North. The trail now bears the name of Giscome as one of the first non-natives to travel across the portage. After being petitioned, the government constructed a wagon road over the Giscome Portage, and the navigation on the Crooked River was improved in 1871. Despite the numerous travellers using the Giscome Portage, no actual community developed there until the early years of the 20th century. This community was later to be known as the Huble Homestead. World War I initiated the decline of Giscome Portage and the decline accelerated with the construction of a road between Prince George and Summit Lake in 1919. Giscome Portage was bypassed as the transportation method shifted from water to road.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Wildlife:</strong>\n    Park Visitors are able to view many species of native wildlife within a natural setting.

There’s something new, different and exciting every month of the year at Goldstream Park.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Goldstream’s numerous trails criss-cross through the dramatically different terrain of two distinct vegetation zones. The park is home to 600-year-old Douglas fir trees and western red cedar, mixed with western yew and hemlock, red alder, big leaf maple and black cottonwood. On the drier ridges visitors can find flowering dogwood, lodgepole pine and arbutus. The arbutus, with its thick leathery evergreen leaves, red-dish trunk and peeling bark, is Canada’s only broad-leafed evergreen and is found exclusively on Vancouver Island and on the southwest coast of British Columbia. In the spring and early summer, Goldstream overflows with colourful wildflowers, including the shade-loving western trillium and the calypso, a delicate orchid of the mossy forest glades.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Trails range from easy, wheelchair accessible walks to strenuous hikes and track along creeks, through forested uplands and past abandoned gold diggings from the days of the Gold Rush. More adventurous hikers can climb to the top of one of the highest points in Greater Victoria – Mt Finlayson, a recent addition to the park in 1994. Another trail leads you to stunning Niagara Falls, which cascades 47.5 metres down a rock cliff into a crystal clear canyon pool below.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The park is also the site of an annual chum salmon spawning run, which draws thousands of salmon – and visitors – every year. Riverside trails and observation platforms provide extraordinary opportunities to view this natural phenomenon, which also attracts Bald eagles, who swoop down to devour the bodies of the spawned out salmon.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Park naturalists are available at the Freeman King Visitor Center, which offers interpretive programs and informative lectures about the area’s natural history for individuals and groups.

There’s something new, different and exciting every month of the year at Goldstream Park.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Goldstream’s numerous trails criss-cross through the dramatically different terrain of two distinct vegetation zones. The park is home to 600-year-old Douglas fir trees and western red cedar, mixed with western yew and hemlock, red alder, big leaf maple and black cottonwood. On the drier ridges visitors can find flowering dogwood, lodgepole pine and arbutus. The arbutus, with its thick leathery evergreen leaves, red-dish trunk and peeling bark, is Canada’s only broad-leafed evergreen and is found exclusively on Vancouver Island and on the southwest coast of British Columbia. In the spring and early summer, Goldstream overflows with colourful wildflowers, including the shade-loving western trillium and the calypso, a delicate orchid of the mossy forest glades.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Trails range from easy, wheelchair-accessible walks to strenuous hikes and track along creeks, through forested uplands and past abandoned gold diggings from the days of the Gold Rush. More adventurous hikers can climb to the top of one of the highest points in Greater Victoria – Mount Finlayson, a recent addition to the park in 1994. Another trail leads you to stunning Niagara Falls, which cascades 47.5 metres down a rock cliff into a crystal clear canyon pool below.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The park is also the site of an annual chum salmon spawning run, which draws thousands of salmon – and visitors – every year. Riverside trails and observation platforms provide extraordinary opportunities to view this natural phenomenon, which also attracts Bald eagles, who swoop down to devour the bodies of the spawned out salmon.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Park naturalists are available at the Freeman King Visitor Center, which offers interpretive programs and informative lectures about the area’s natural history for individuals and groups. The park also features a large picnic area with shelters, as well as vehicle accessible camping and group sites.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For your convenience during the summer season, this park has a small concession managed by the park operator.\n</p>\n<h4>\n  Special Features\n</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Goldstream Park is home to waterfalls, including\n    <strong>Niagara Falls</strong>, which at 47.5 metres is almost at high as its famous namesake, and\n    <strong>Goldstream Falls</strong>, a small waterfall located in the southwest corner of the park near the campground.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Goldstream is also part of the Nanaimo Lowlands Ecosection and the Coastal Douglas Fir Biogeoclimatic Zone.

The notched stumps supported springboards that allowed old-time loggers to stand above the dense shrubbery so they could cut down the massive trees that dominated the area.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Conservation:</strong>\n    The forest floor is covered with the same kind of shrubs that made such hard work for the fallers: thimbleberry, salal and salmonberry. You can also see vanilla leaf, foamflower and bunchberry which grow closer to the ground. Dolly Varden, Rainbow and Cutthroat trout live in the lake and chum, coho and Chinook salmon spawn in the lake and its tributaries. Steelhead spawn in the Cowichan River. Rare rocky mountain juniper adds to the uniqueness of the area. Adjacent to Gordon Bay Provincial Park is Honeymoon Bay Ecological Reserve, which protects a variety of rare and endangered plant species.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Wildlife:</strong>\n    As you walk through the forest, look for deer, raccoons and red squirrels. Birdwatchers often see juncos, Stellar’s jays and chestnut-backed chickadees, as well as mergansers and golden eye ducks. Black bears, Roosevelt elk, black-tail deer, beaver, raccoons and cougars can all be spotted in the park.\n  </li>\n</ul>",

More than 25 kilometres of trails, varying in degree of difficulty, offer spectacular views, as well as the chance to view animals in their natural environment. In spring and early summer, the moss-covered rocky knolls come alive with a carpet of colourful, vibrant wildflowers.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Located near Victoria on southern Vancouver Island, the park preserves a heritage of green space for present and future generations. It encompasses nearly the entire east side of Saanich Inlet, stretching from Goldstream to Brentwood Bay and the world-famous Butchart Gardens.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Gowlland Tod protects a significant part of the Gowlland Range, one of the last remaining natural areas in Greater Victoria, and a significant portion of the natural shoreline and uplands of Tod Inlet. The Gowlland Range is a particularly rich area of biodiversity, with more than 150 individual animal and plant species identified. The protected area preserves a rare, dry coastal Douglas fir habitat that features grassy meadows, rocky knolls and old-growth forest. The park also protects a wetland area which provides habitat for the blue-listed Northern red-legged frog and associated riparian areas habitat for the fragrant white rein orchid.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The Gowlland Range towers 430 metres over Finlayson Arm, a unique fjord that only replenishes its marine waters once a year. Species that are rare elsewhere in the world flourish in this isolated and stable habitat. The abundance of marine activity attracts scuba divers from around the world, as well as boaters seeking the calm waters and sheltered anchorage of Tod Inlet.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Visitors to the park will find reminders of the area’s early pioneer activity, as well as remains of settlements associated with the Vancouver Portland Cement Company, which thrived here in the early 1900s. The area has been, and continues to be, important to First Nation peoples, who utilize areas of the park for medicinal, ceremonial and spiritual purposes.\n  <br>\n</p>",

He worked at the Port Essington cannery where he met and married Kate Spence (a native woman from Victoria, BC) and had four children (Willie, Walter, Rhoderic and Hilda). They later moved to Lakelse Lake near Terrace, where Peter logged and trapped. Peter became president of the Liberal Association of the north and a Liberal candidate for Skeena in 1903, but lost. Peter died in a drowning accident in 1907. His body was never found.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong>\n    Hai Lake – Mount Herman Park lies within the traditional territory of the Kitselas First Nation. This park and the surrounding area are important to First Nations peoples for sustenance and cultural activities. In recent times the area has been a popular skating, fishing and camping location for Terrace residents and Boy Scouts.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Conservation:</strong>\n    The Herman Lake wetland is a Class 1 (&gt; 5 ha) riparian wetland that contains regionally significant salmon spawning and rearing habitat and Herman Creek is a salmonid spawning stream. The bog ecosystem around Herman Lake contains scattered and stunted Lodgepole Pine, Western Red Cedar, and Western Hemlock. In addition to water loving shrubs and herbs, the bogs contain specialized plants such as Sundew, White Bog Orchids and Bog Club Moss. Accumulations of moss and organic material are often greater than 100 cm and water tables are within 20 cm of the surface. The bog system is very susceptible to disturbance. Organic soils and dwarf shrubs can be severely damaged by vehicles and trampling. Re-growth after damage is slow. Regionally significant old growth Western Hemlock forest is located in the park (approximately 95 ha). This is one of the very few remaining old growth stands in the main Kitimat – Kitsumkalum valley.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"/plan-your-trip/visit-responsibly/wildlife-safety\">\n      Wildlife Safety</a>\n  </li>\n</ul>",

The name commemorates Victor Edward John Breton Von Donop, RN. Von Donop, a midshipman, arrived aboard HMS Charybis at Esquimalt in 1862. Charybis, a ship of 21 guns, had been dispatched to Canada from China at the time of the American Civil War when it seemed possible that hostilities might break out between Great Britain and the United States.

The old-growth forest between the inlet and Robertson/Wiley Lakes and the mature second-growth forest along the outlet of Robertson Lake are part of the area’s mosaic. Undergrowth, in the form of red huckleberry, salal, Oregon grape and other shrubs and shade-tolerant ferns and flowering plants contributes to this forest’s natural diversity.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Wildlife:</strong>\n    The park is home to Flying squirrels and Douglas squirrels, as well as river otter and mink. Harbour seals are often seen in the inlet, and during the winter months, Steller’s and California sea lions are present. Killer whales occasionally pass through Sutil Channel, but rarely enter the inlet. Háthayim contains excellent shellfish, including butter clams and littleneck clams. Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP) may be present from May through August. Please check with the Department of Fisheries inCampbell River for recent information on harvesting and PSP regulations. Other forms of sea life present include jellyfish, sea sponges, cucumbers, octopus and turnicates. Nearby waters are noted for salmon and rockfish. Seabird populations increase during the winter months in the park. During spring and summer, visitors can hear the calls of varied thrush and Swainson’s thrush, a variety of flycatchers as well as yellow-rumped townsend’s and black-throated grey warblers.

The remoteness of the area brought inherent risks to Annie and her family; cougars prowled endlessly nearby, sensing easy prey. Ada Annie Rae-Arthur shot and trapped dozens of the animals and thus emerged the legend of Cougar Annie. This garden is now one of British Columbia’s premier heritage gardens. Surrounded by the tall trees of the West Coast rainforest, Cougar Annie’s garden is a place of strange and compelling beauty. From this remote location, Annie ran a nursery garden and shipped countless varieties of plants across Canada. For decades she advertised her wares (and occasionally for husbands) in the Western Producer and in the Winnipeg Free Press. The garden consists of a five-acre clearing, criss-crossed with more than two kilometres of meandering pathways and dotted with outbuildings that once housed goats and chickens. Resurrected from a tangle of salal, Scotch broom, and salmonberry, this garden has endured for nearly 100 years. The survival and the continuity of the garden make it an important heritage site.

That is one way to describe the cave resources of Vancouver Island, home to more than 1,000 caves. At Horne Lake Caves Provincial Park you can experience the magic of the underground world in the many caves protected within this unique park. The park was established in 1971 at the request of public caving groups on Vancouver Island who were concerned about the potential damage of the caves and the fragile crystal formations they contained.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The park can be enjoyed above or below ground. For those that prefer their adventures above-ground, the park also offers a Cave &amp; Karst Education Centre that features geology information, a small museum and fossil display in addition to Canada’s only Cave Theatre, so visitors can learn more about this unique environment without having to venture underground. Other above-ground opportunities include a self-guided walk through the amazing surface geology on the “Phil Whitfield Interpretive Trail” that highlights interesting surface features detailed in a self-guiding brochure.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Spelunking is the art of cave exploration and Horne Lake Caves Provincial Park is the perfect place to discover this unique activity. From educational family-oriented tours to deep, dark adventure, the caves protected within this park offer something for everyone. Knowledgeable guides can lead visitors through the caves to discover this magical world of crystal formations and ancient fossils firsthand. Though the park has two small caves visitors can explore on their own, a guided tour of one of the larger caves offers more variety and a chance to learn about the cave’s unique geology and history.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Whichever method of exploring the caves you choose, you are bound to be fascinated by this amazing underground world in the heart of Vancouver Island.\n  <br>\n  <strong>Park Size:</strong>\n  158 hectares\n  <br>\n  <strong>Date Established:</strong>\n  January 26, 1971\n</p>",

      "natureAndCulture": "<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>History</strong>\n    - The first written records of caves in the area came after the turn of the century, in 1912, when a geologist noted the presence of caves at the north end of Horne Lake. A few years later, when the area was opened up for logging, the loggers knew the location of the caves. It is not known if the loggers ventured into the depths of the caves but a stream in one of the caves was dammed to provide water for the steam donkeys used in early logging practices.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    It was not until 1939 that the caves gained public attention. Two cave explorers were responsible for rediscovering what they named the “Horne Lake Wonder Caves”. At this point only the Main and Lower Main Caves were known, although some speculated on the potential for more caves in the area. The presence of a noticeable air current at the mouth of Main Cave led people to believe there must be a system of caves, of which Main was just a part. In 1941, a storekeeper from Qualicum reported entering a sizable cave almost a quarter of a mile long, some distance from the already discovered caves. This was probably the first discovery of Riverbend Cave.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    By 1945, the caves had become a known tourist stop for people looking for adventure. This increased use of the caves, however, took its toll and by the summer of 1945 a party of explorers noted that many of the once beautiful formations were either broken or removed by souvenir seekers. This same party found the storekeeper’s cave, Riverbend.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    In 1957, the Horne Lake Caves area of approximately 29 hectares was established as a recreation reserve in an effort to ensure opportunities for the public to continue to view these caves in the future. Six years later a group of cavers from Victoria discovered the two entrances to Eggshell Cave. The value of this area was recognized by members of the Canadian Speleological Society, who then approached the provincial government to have this area protected. Horne Lake Caves Provincial Park was established in February 1971.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Conservation</strong>\n    - In addition to protecting the karst features and caves, this park includes a forested addition that protects approximately 1 km of the Qualicum River adjacent to Horne Lake Caves. This forest provides a visual buffer for visitors to the existing park. The area also protects high fish and wildlife values.\n  </li>\n</ul>",

      "description": "Jackman Flats Provincial Park is a product of ice and wind. At the end of the last ice age, some 11,000 years ago, winds from the main trench of the Fraser River and from, what is now, Kinbasket Lake, deposited vast quantities of sand in the Jackman Flats area. This created an ecosystem considered unique in British Columbia. Rare plant communities and shifting sand dune structures now exist in this rather small park.\n<br>\n<br>\nExcellent recreational opportunities have been enjoyed by Robson Valley residents for many years in this special area. Unregulated motorized use, primarily from all-terrain vehicles, has had a devastating effect on not only the rare plant communities but on the structural integrity of the sand dunes. The uniqueness of Jackman Flats can be quickly appreciated when one considers that one plant community, Juniperus-Stereocaulon, is found nowhere else in British Columbia.\n<br>\n<br>\nAn extremely dry area, where drought conditions generally exist through the summer season, Jackman Flats is vulnerable to excessive recreation use. Hiking, and cross-country skiing are permitted on existing trails only. Excellent opportunities exist for bird watching and plant identification. The parks most prominent residents are the variety of lichen species that dominate the landscape. The fragile nature, distribution and abundance of these lichens can be preserved by staying on designated trails. Remember, to collect or damage any natural object in a provincial park is illegal. Tread lightly and enjoy one of BC Parks most unique landscapes.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Established Date:</strong>\nJune 29, 2000\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Park Size</strong>: 615 hectares",

There are four trailheads to the\n  <a href=\"hiking#hiking\">\n    Juan de Fuca Trail</a>\n  at Juan de Fuca East (<a href=\"trailhd\" class=\"legacy-link\">\n    China Beach</a>),\n  <a href=\"trailhd\" class=\"legacy-link\">\n    Sombrio Beach</a>,\n  <a href=\"trailhd\" class=\"legacy-link\">\n    Parkinson Creek</a>\n  and\n  <a href=\"trailhd\" class=\"legacy-link\">\n    Botanical Beach</a>. Although most of the Juan de Fuca Marine Trail is designed for strenuous day or multi-day hiking/camping in this rugged and isolated area, some easy to moderate day hiking opportunities to the beach or along the trail are available starting from the trailheads.\n</p>\n<p>\n  At the east end of the park you’ll find the China Beach day-use area and the vehicle accessible, frontcountry China Beach campground. The campground is located in a forested area with open understory, about 1 km east of the China Beach day-use parking area and the Juan de Fuca Marine Trail east trailhead. A 1km trail connect the campground to Second Beach which is, located east of the larger China Beach day-use. It is possible to walk along the beach from Second Beach to China Beach, tides and conditions permitting.\n</p>\n<p>\n  At the west end of Juan de Fuca Park is Botanical Beach, one of the richest tidal areas along the west coast. Botanical Beach also has a unique shoreline framed by ridges of shale and quartz, which jut up through the black basalt to form huge tableaus. Botanical Beach is the western terminus for the Juan de Fuca Marine Trail and a popular day trip destination for visitors wishing to observe this sensitive and unique ecosystem. Wildlife viewing is best done at low tide, when visitors can walk out across the flat sandstone and granite outcroppings to view tide pools filled with brightly coloured marine life.\n</p>\n<p>\n  When visiting Botanical Beach, please look in the tide pools only – do not touch the marine life. Do not remove, collect or disturb any tide pool life, shells, plants, flowers, kelp, etc. Even touching the water in a tide pool with sunscreen on your hands can create an “oil slick” that could kill the vulnerable creatures in this sensitive ecosystem. Remember to bring your camera, as photographs make great souvenirs.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Juan de Fuca Provincial Park offers ample opportunity to view larger marine mammals as well, including Grey and killer whales, which can often be spotted feeding just off the points. The best time to see Grey whales is during their migration from the Mexican coast to Alaska in March and April. Seals and sea lions can also often be seen playing offshore.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Special Features:\n  </strong>This park contains numerous special natural features, including waterfalls, grottos, old growth forest, estuaries, tide pools and shale and quartz rock formations.\n</p>",

Preservation of a living legacy of unprecedented natural beauty, accessible to all, was considered a fitting tribute to the spirit of the Games.\n    <br>\n    Construction and preservation of the Trail has been made possible by the efforts of government, local industries, First Nations and citizens. Land exchanges and gifts of land have come from Western Forest Products and Timber West. Trail upgrades have been undertaken with funding from Forest Renewal BC and the Environment Youth Team (E-Team).\n    <br>\n    The Juan de Fuca Marine Trail was originally part of a lifesaving trail that serviced this area, known at the time as the Graveyard of the Pacific.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Conservation:</strong>\n    The park protects significant marine tidal pool life at Botanical Beach as well as black bear and cougar habitat. The region is so biologically significant that the University of Minnesota installed the first marine research station in the Pacific Northwest at Botanical Beach in 1901. Since then, the area has been used for research by a number of universities in BC and Washington. Red, purple and orange starfish and sea urchins, white gooseneck barnacles, blue mussels and green seas anemones and sea cucumbers only begin to hint at the colourful spectrum of intertidal life thriving here.\n    <br>\n    Do not harvest shellfish or other plants and animals. They form an important part of the area’s natural environment and are protected under the Provincial Park Act.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"/plan-your-trip/visit-responsibly/wildlife-safety\">\n      General Wildlife, Marine &amp; Outdoor Ethics Information</a>\n  </li>\n</ul>",

This unique landscape is a place of spectacular scenery, with cliffs and hoodoos breaking the grassland benches.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe park was originally part of a Wildlife Management Area managed by BC Environment. It was then proposed for protection through a wide variety of planning processes including the Protected Areas Strategy and the Cariboo-Chilcotin CORE process, and was designated a provincial park in 1995 through the Cariboo-Chilcotin Land Use Plan.

Kekuli pits and six sites of lithic artifacts are located in the park along with evidence of small village clusters of pit houses and a larger cultural village. As well, Cosens Bay was the site of a World War Two mortar practice range.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Conservation:</strong>\n    Ponderosa pine and groves of Douglas-fir are found in the northern portion of the Park, while Douglas fir, cedar and hemlock dominate the area south of Cosens Bay. To date, 432 varieties of vascular plants have been identified in the park, a rare find in such a small area. Included is the red-listed Flat-topped broom-rape. The grasslands above Cosens Bay are part of an ecosystem that is rapidly disappearing in the Okanagan Valley. Kalamalka Lake is one of a handful of unique bodies of water known as marl lakes. When the lake warms in summer, calcium carbonate, or limestone, forms crystals that reflect sunlight and create its distinctive blue and green colours.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Wildlife:</strong>\n    There is an abundance of rare and endangered wildlife in this park. White-tailed deer, mule deer, mink, bobcat, black bear, cougar, coyote and red fox occur in the park. Blue-listed mammals include the Western harvest mouse and Townsend’s big-eared bat. A great spot for birdwatchers, the park provides habitat for the Canada goose, Canyon wren, White-throated swift, Western screech owl and Flammulated owl, all of which are blue-listed species. The variety of reptiles here is vast, including pacific rubber boa, western rattlesnake, western yellow-bellied racer, gopher snake, northeastern garter snake, common garter snake, western painted turtle, Great Basin spadefoot toad, and northern alligator lizard. There is even a unique insect, the Immaculate green hairstreak.\n  </li>\n</ul>",

Many young shade trees were planted and the grassy areas between the sites are beautifully landscaped. The young trees planted 10 years ago have begun to mature and provide shade and privacy around the sites, especially on the upper loops.\n</p>\n<p>\n  There are irrigated grassy areas between the sites full of beautiful trees and shrubs including rose bushes that are in full bloom during the spring.

      "description": "<p>\n  <strong>K’tzim-a-deen is the “Valley at the Head of the Inlet” (Coast Tsimshian)</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n  The Khutzeymateen Provincial Park [a.k.a. Khutzeymateen/K’tzim-a-deen Grizzly Bear Sanctuary] was established as a Class A Park in 1994 as the first area in Canada to be protected specifically for grizzly bears and their habitat. Class A parks are dedicated to the preservation of their natural environments for the inspiration, use and enjoyment of the public.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The park represents the first undisturbed estuary of its size to be protected along the north coast of BC. The topography of this land and marine sanctuary is diverse, with rugged peaks towering to 2100 metres above a valley of wetlands, old growth temperate rainforests and a large river estuary. An abundance of wildlife shares the area.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The Khutzeymateen Inlet Conservancy was established in 2008 to further enhance and ensure protection of key grizzly bear intertidal and foreshore habitats throughout the inlet. A conservancy is set aside for four reasons:\n</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    The protection and maintenance of their biological diversity and natural environments;\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    The preservation and maintenance of social, ceremonial and cultural uses of First Nations;\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    The protection and maintenance of their recreational values; and,\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    To ensure that development or use of their natural resources occurs in a sustainable manner consistent with the purposes of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c).\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n  The Khutzeymateen group of protected areas continues to play a key role in the conservation of grizzly bears in North America by protecting a large part of the ecosystem in which they live. Grizzly bears depend on a healthy and fully functioning ecosystem which supports a variety of animals and fish.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Coast Tsimshian First Nations depend upon this area, as they have for thousands of years, as the source of their social, economic and cultural prosperity. Coast Tsimshian continue to conduct traditional activities in the K’tzim-a-deen and provide public education to explain their relationship to the area.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The area continues to offer incredible opportunities to view grizzly bears in their natural habitat. Human use of the area focuses on bear viewing, natural and cultural education, and traditional activities. The K’tzim-a-deen protected areas play an important role in British Columbia’s protected areas system. The protected areas are known internationally as Canada’s first Grizzly Bear sanctuary and are home to one of the highest concentrations of grizzly bears in Canada.\n</p>\n<p>\n  BC Parks, the Coast Tsimshian First Nations, and the Gitsi’is Tribe collaboratively manage the protected areas.\n</p>\n<h4>Khutzeymateen Protected Areas Commercial Bear Viewing Partnership</h4>\n<p>\n  BC Parks, Lax Kw’alaams and Commercial Bear Viewing Guides have developed a collaborative Partnership that ensures the Khutzeymateen Protected Areas continue to be managed proactively and public access monitored conservatively to ensure the Grizzly Bears and their habitats are the first priority.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The bear viewing guides contribute a per person donation to the Khutzeymateen Park Enhancement Fund that collectively supports shared stewardship initiatives for Khutzeymateen Protected Areas including:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    the K’tzim-a-deen Visitor Centre and interpretation services;\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    natural and cultural resource monitoring and research; and to\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    ensure visitors to the Khutzeymateen Protected Areas receive an orientation on responsible bear viewing techniques.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"pdf/guides-permitted-within-sanctuary.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"legacy-link\">\n      Businesses that are permitted by BC Parks to guide within Khutzeymateen Protected Area’s [PDF]\n    </a>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Khutzeymateen Park Enhancement Fund</h4>\n<p>\n  You can help support the protection and management of grizzly bears and this unique partnership by donating to the Khutzeymateen\n  <a href=\"/get-involved/donate#page-section-15\">\n    Park Enhancement Fund</a>.

      "natureAndCulture": "<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>History:</strong>\n    The first settlers to pre-empt land in this area were farmers, one of whom started milling lumber in 1870. From 1870 to 1910, a succession of sawmills came into operation and with them, the community grew. Thomas Kilby came to Harrison Mills in 1902 and by 1904, had built a three-story building consisting of a general store and hotel. His son, Acton and wife, Jessie ran this operation until their retirement in 1976. The Provincial Government acquired this area. Today, the general store is a museum and is operated by the Ministry responsible for Tourism. The beach area has been developed into a riverside park with 22 campsites, a small day-use area, and a boat launch under the jurisdiction of BC Parks.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong>\n    The Harrison and Fraser Rivers served as major transportation routes for the local First Nations population. In the mid to late 1800s, the Fraser River and Cariboo gold rushes created considerable activity along the Harrison River, near the site of this historic park.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Conservation:</strong>\n    The park lies within the Coastal Western Hemlock biogeoclimatic zone and is representative of the Fraser floodplain landscape. Upland vegetation includes cottonwood, poplar, alder, and willow while the understory consists largely of red currant and salmonberry.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Wildlife:</strong>\n    Kilby Provincial Park is a designated British Columbia Wildlife Watch area. It is an excellent location to view large concentrations of wintering Bald Eagles as well as graceful trumpeter swans that migrate to the area from Alaska. Other common bird species to the park area include ravens, geese, eagles, swans, finches, chickadees and jays. Coho and Spring salmon can be found in Harrison River which borders the park.\n  </li>\n</ul>",

This zone occurs at low to mid-elevations. In general, it is one of the wettest areas in BC and typically has cool summers and mild winters. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 100-440 cm. The park is situated on an active floodplain of the Kitimat River. Vegetation differences throughout the park depend on differences in bench height and frequency of flooding. The soils in active floodplains are usually poorly developed.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    High bench sites have seasonally fluctuating water tables, but only flood every few years. Forests are typically dominated by Sitka Spruce, however Red Cedar, Western Hemlock and Amabilis Fir are also present. The shrub layer is dominated by Devil’s Club. Small amounts of Salmonberry, Alaskan and Oval-leaf Blueberry and young conifers are also present in the understory. Spiny Wood Fern, Oak Fern, Foamflowers, Twisted Stock, and leafy mosses are also common in this plant community.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    Middle bench plant communities have high and prolonged water tables that limit conifer establishment. The most common species in this area are Black Cottonwood, Red-Osier Dogwood, Red Alder, and Salmonberry.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    The low bench plant communities are found adjacent to the river and back channels and are subjected to prolonged annual flooding, sediment erosion and deposition. The occasional Black Cottonwood is found in this area, but the most common species are willows along with Red and Sitka Alder.\n  </li>\n</ul>",

Eulachon oil from the Pacific Coast was rendered and carried in cedar boxes along this route, often referred to as the Grease Trail. Dried fish, cedar-bark and berries from the coast were also traded for moose hides, beaver and obsidian from the interior. Many Indigenous people from the Southern Carrier Nation lived seasonally along sections of the trail and continue to do so today. Archaeological research has identified prehistoric sites near or on the trail, with evidence of stone tool use or manufacture and recognized heritage values that go back thousands of years.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    Members of the Southern Carrier Nation guided Alexander Mackenzie on this trail in 1793, during his search to find a trade route to the Pacific Coast for the Northwest Company. Mackenzie was the first European to cross North America. Kluskoil Lake Park encompasses only a short portion of the Heritage Trail. Mackenzie and his party of nine men camped in what is now the park, beside the Blackwater River west of Kluskoil Lake, on July 8th, 1793.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Conservation:</strong>\n    A very rough road runs through the park and sections of it travel over the Alexander Mackenzie Heritage Trail.

Please stay on the road if travelling in a vehicle or ATV. The trail is managed by the Forest Service outside the park.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    The park supports numerous wetlands in a rolling landscape, and contains important habitat for moose, fisher, lynx, and aquatic furbearers. It also encompasses two small untouched watersheds that are representative of the region. The Blackwater (West Road) River, its tributaries and Kluskoil Lake support a high diversity of fish species.

      "natureAndCulture": "<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>History:</strong>\n    Kokanee Creek Park is located on the old “Busk” estate site. Charles W. Busk was a wealthy English gentleman who came to Nelson in the late 1800’s. He had acquired a large tract of land with lake frontage 14 miles from Nelson. From plans drawn by English architects, Busk built a large mansion that once sat on a rise a short way up Kokanee Glacier Road. As a country squire and gracious gentlemen, Mr. Busk enjoyed entertaining guests but also had many interests in surveying, mining, fruit ranching and Scouting. He lived an eloquent, lavish life style. After 1913 the romance of his new way of life had dulled and it is estimated he went through three fortunes. Sadly, within a few years he died, disillusioned by most of his ventures, withdrawn and ignored by friends whom he once had entertained so lavishly. The park as it is seen today was originally established in 1955.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong>\n    Archaeological evidence in the park indicates seasonal campsites used by First Nations people. Remains of European settlement include evidence of old homesteads and an early estate. Nearby are mining ghost towns and village museums displaying the Kootenay area history.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Conservation:</strong>\n    With 257 hectares, Kokanee Creek Park has extensive sandy beaches and a large delta area. Backed by a gentle rising upland, this area gives way to the forested slopes of the Slocan Range of the Selkirk Mountains. Kokanee Creek bisects the landscape to form a steep canyon. The park protects the active alluvial creek fan with its marshes and extensive sandspit. Both the Englemann spruce/subalpine fir and the interior cedar/hemlock biogeoclimatic zones occur here. Prime growing conditions within the park produce a diverse mix of vegetation with magnificent specimens of fir, hemlock and pine. There are both pure and mixed stands of deciduous trees as well as many of the common understory plants including wild rose, queen’s cup and skunk cabbage. Flowers, trees and shrubs are part of the park’s natural heritage, please do not damage or remove them.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Wildlife:</strong>\n    The Kokanee Creek Delta ecology includes many species of plants and animals. A variety of habitats support coyotes, beaver, whitetail and mule deer and a large number of birds ranging from the tiny Rufous hummingbird to the great blue heron. Many of the birds are migratory but kingfishers, woodpeckers and dippers can by seen throughout the year. The park also has important man-made and some natural spawning channels for kokanee salmon, which spawn in large numbers in the late summer.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    Park visitors should always be aware of bears and other wildlife in our park environment.

      "description": "<p>\n  Located north of Nelson, ruggedly beautiful Kokanee Glacier Park offers excellent backcountry adventure for the whole family. Sitting mostly above 1,800 metres in elevation, the park has two glaciers – Kokanee and Woodbury – which feed over 30 lakes and are the headwaters of many creeks.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Kokanee Lake is 1,200 metres in length and 400 metres wide; surrounded by precipitous cliffs and rock slides, it is an alpine jewel. Other scenic lakes in the park include the gem-coloured Sapphire Lakes, milky Joker Lakes and popular Gibson, Kaslo and Tanal Lakes, which offer good fishing for rainbow and cutthroat trout. With 85 km of well-marked trails, this park is appropriate for campers, hikers and climbers with all levels of outdoor experience.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Kokanee Glacier Provincial Park, set aside in 1922, is one of the oldest major parks in the provincial system. It has a long history of well established recreational use and is perhaps the best known alpine park in the Kootenay area of British Columbia. Its boundaries encompass 32,035 hectares of some of the most scenic mountain country found in the Selkirk Mountains of southern British Columbia, comprising a picturesque mosaic of high peaks, snowfields, cirques and colourful lake basins.\n</p>\n<p>\n  As the dominant feature and roughly in the park’s centre, Kokanee Glacier forms the culmination of mountain ridges and valleys leading in from Kootenay and Slocan Lake. Slowly regenerating burns, old growth spruce stands, open slide paths and meadowlands lend contrast and heighten the beauty of the Park’s mountain landscape.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Access to the park was developed from old mining and forestry roads. Leading from these various road ends, trails dating to the early mining developments offer a variety of hiking opportunities ranging from short day trips to challenging cross-country routes; for the status of the main access routes, please\n  <a href=\"trail_report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"legacy-link\">\n    check the most recent trail report [PDF]\n  </a>. Historical cabins and interesting old mine sites combine with many natural features including peaks, lakes and alpine basins to form a rich and diverse environment for back-country recreation.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The park straddles the crest of mountain ridges between Slocan Lake and Kootenay Lake. Located 30 kilometres to the northeast, the peaks of Kokanee Glacier are visible from the city of Nelson, and stand out as dominant skyline features from many points on Kootenay Lake.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Weather patterns in the park are typical of the Southern Interior Mountains, With the whole Park area over 1,500 metres, elevation strongly influences weather conditions and while warm spells occur in July and August, Park visitors should be aware of the highly changeable nature of mountain weather. Snow and sleet are not uncommon in summer, and rainy weather, many times in the form of thunderstorms, can be expected in the spring, summer and autumn months.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The heavy snowfall accumulations in the Park can be counted upon to ensure excellent ski conditions from late autumn to early spring. Snow can occur in October at all levels in the Park and the higher elevations are not likely to be snow-free until July. Avalanches are prevalent on the open alpine slope, limiting ski touring possibilities to certain routes and to low risk periods.\n</p>",

Geologically, this area is composed of an immense system of granite rock known as the Nelson batholith.

These became the deposits and finger-like veins, rich in gold and silver ore that caused the local mining boom at the end of the 19th century. Several mines paid quite well but most were worked for only a few years. Many of the park’s trails were originally built for miners hauling ore and supplies. Today we can only marvel at the tenacity of those prospectors, who clung to steep rock faces throughout the park while trying to scratch a living from their mining claims.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Conservation:</strong>\n    The park’s primary roles are to:\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        Represent sub-alpine, alpine landscapes and associated ecological resources of the Selkirk Mountain ranges.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Conserve grizzly bear and mountain goat habitat.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Maintain the characteristics and qualities of the natural environment and associated features, and\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Conserve cultural heritage of the early alpine mining history of the West Kootenays.\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Vegetation:</strong>\n    Vegetation is typical of this elevation, with exposed bedrock and gravel moraine near the peaks where only lichens and a few other hardy plants survive. Stunted Engelmann spruce and white-bark pine are common at the timberline, with beautiful sub-alpine flower meadows in the wetter areas. The numerous steep slopes and avalanche paths support slide alder and huckleberry. The lower, more protected slopes are forested with Engelmann spruce, subalpine fir, lodgepole pine, hemlock and western red cedar. The few pure stands of subalpine larch are particularly stunning in October when their needles turn golden-yellow in the fading sun.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Wildlife:</strong>\n    Bird species such as the blue grouse and Franklin grouse inhabit the forests, and ptarmigan are often seen in the open areas. Golden eagles are occasionally seen soaring majestically overhead. Small animals such as the hoary marmot, pika, ground squirrels, and marten are common, while larger species such as the mountain goat, mule deer and black bear are present in lesser numbers. The park contains most of the range for several grizzly bears, and further protection of significant grizzly bear habitat was the main reason for the expansion of the park in 1995. Separation of people and grizzlies is an important management objective - for the protection of both parties. To protect these endangered bears, areas such as the Coffee Creek drainage have no development and use is discouraged. Other trails are carefully designed to avoid bear habitat or closed at certain times of the year when bears are known to be feeding on ripe berries nearby.\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"/plan-your-trip/visit-responsibly/wildlife-safety\">\n          General Wildlife, Marine &amp; Outdoor Ethics Information</a>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>",

Beyond the grasslands, ancient ponderosa pines in a sea of bluebunch wheatgrass give way to groves of trembling aspen and stands of Douglas fir, some of which are believed to be over 400 years old. California bighorn sheep, mule deer, black bear and waterfowl are common residents and visitors to the protected area, while the Northern Pacific rattlesnake, sharp-tailed grouse and flammulated owl live more secretive lives within its boundaries.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Lac du Bois Grasslands Protected Area is your protected area. We hope you will visit it often and enjoy the values for which it was established. BC Parks is looking to the local community and other users for their support in managing this fragile area.\n</p>",

From the intersection of Fortune Drive and Tranquille Road, take 8th Street north through two sets of traffic lights. At the overpass, move into the left-hand lane and turn straight ahead up the hill between the subdivisions. At the cattle guard the surface changes to gravel and is a good, but narrow, well-traveled road. Expect to meet logging trucks and school buses.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    B: In the west,\n    <strong>Tranquille-Criss Creek Forest Service Road</strong>\n    (also known as Red Lake Road) rises steeply to the Dewdrop Range and the deep canyon of Tranquille Valley. From the intersection of Fortune Drive and Tranquille Road, follow Tranquille Road past the airport towards Tranquille. Turn right over the railway tracks and around the fields before crossing the Tranquille River and going up the long, gradual hill. At the sharp blind 180 degree turn, there are two choices: go straight ahead to Dewdrop Flats and the red lava cliffs of Dewdrop Range; or go around the corner and up the hill to follow the spectacular Tranquille canyon. Expect to meet logging trucks and other local traffic.\n  </li>\n</ul>\nTwo other roads give vehicle access to the protected area, each leading into a different type of scenery:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Long Lake Road:</strong>\n    From the ATV area on the Lac du Bois Road, Long Lake Road winds its way through the grasslands to the forests past rolling hills and small ponds. It is a narrow, dirt track, steep in places; closed during winter and spring break-up or during adverse conditions that would affect the stability of the road.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Dairy Creek Road:</strong>\n    To get to the north edge of the protected area, take this logging road that runs through Douglas fir forest and beside deeply entrenched streams. It can be reached by following Westsyde Road. It is a narrow, gravel road steep in places; an alternative route when weather conditions permit. It connects to the north end of the Long Lake Road and eventually connects to the Lac du Bois Road. There are many junctions along the way so a good map is essential.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  The road lying to the west of Wheeler Mountain is deeply rutted and partly washed out in places. It is not recommended for public use.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Vehicle access is limited to only those roads shown on the map; all other trails are closed to motorized vehicles. Not all roads are passable by two-wheel drive, low-clearance vehicles and weather conditions may severely change driving conditions.\n</p>",

Horses of the Hudson’s Bay Company roamed the area in the 1860s and cows grazed in large numbers as the beef industry expanded in the early decades of the century. Sheep in large flocks were over-wintered in the 1940s before being taken to summer pastures west of the Fraser River. All these activities took their toll on the fragile grassland communities.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      A fenced pasture rotation system was put in place in 1977 that controls how cattle use the grasslands. This has lead to a marked improvement in the condition of the grasslands.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Cattle are a part of the history and culture of Lac du Bois.

      "description": "<div>\n  <p>\n    Lac La Hache is one of the most popular recreation lakes along Highway 97. There are many stories to explain how the lake was named; according to one, it gained its name when a trapper lost his only hatchet axe when chopping a hole in the frozen lake. This area is rich in tales of fur traders, gold seekers and cattle ranchers. By the 1860’s, gold fever was running high, as miners searched for the motherlode first near Likely, and later at Barkerville. With teams of horses, mules and oxen, the fortune-seekers plodded north along the Cariboo Wagon Road skirting the eastern shores of the lake.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Nowadays, Lac La Hache Park is a stopping point for weary travellers. Set amongst a stately Douglas-fir forest, the cool, green conifers shade campers from the hot Cariboo sun. Lac La Hache Park is located on Highway 97, 13 km north of the community of Lac La Hache. Established in 1956, with 83 campsites, flush toilets, tap water, a sani-station and a self-guided nature trail, Lac La Hache Park is a very pleasant campground. The day-use area is located across Highway 97 on the shore of Lac La Hache and has an adventure playground, picnic tables, picnic shelter, boat launch, developed beach, changehouse and flush toilets.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    This is an excellent fishing lake for Kokanee and lake trout, as well as rainbow trout and burbot during the summer months. However, fishing need not be your only recreational pursuit, as the lake is also a popular place for power boating and water-skiing.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The Heritage House at 108 Mile is a half-hour drive from the campground, and is open from May to September. The campground host or\n    <a href=\"#contact\">\n      park operator</a>\n    can inform you of other things to do in the area, as well as boat rental locations. The community of Lac La Hache offers a grocery store, gas station, bakery, ice cream parlour and a few restaurants.\n  </p>\n</div>",

      "natureAndCulture": "<div>\n  <ul>\n    <li>\n      <strong>History:</strong>\n      The historic Cariboo Wagon road runs through the park. This was originally just a trail used by fur traders from 1803 to 1810. During the Cariboo Gold Rush of the 1860’s it was rebuilt, and it linked the gold fields of the Cariboo to the gold markets of the world, via the shipyards of Vancouver. One of the stops on the park’s Interpretive Trail is on the actual Wagon Road. The overgrown track seems a far cry from our modern Highway 97.\n      <br>\n      One of the stopping points on the Wagon Road for weary miners was the Blue Tent Ranch. It was built by the Wright family in 1862, after they discovered that cattle and the roadhouse provided a much steadier income than gold mining. The present day park is located on part of the original ranch land. Throughout the park, you can see the stumps from the lumber used to build the original ranch house. This heritage house still stands today, and can be seen next to the highway, roughly three kilometres north of the park. Lac La Hache was established as a Class A Provincial Park in 1956.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong>\n      Both the Shuswap and Chilcotin First Nations used the area. Long before the lure of wealth brought the fur traders west, the Shuswap Indians established pit houses near the present day village of Lac La Hache. The Chilcotins named the lake Kumatakwa, meaning Chief or Queen of the waters.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <strong>Conservation:</strong>\n      The park is in the Interior Douglas Fir Zone, which is found in BC’s dry interior. There is a superb old-growth stand of Douglas-fir trees surrounding the campground. A fire in the 1960’s burned several hectares, and you can still see the scars on the bases of some fir trees, their thick bark allowed these trees to survive. Fire is part of natural succession here – sunlight reaching the forest floor allows the growth of trembling aspen and lodgepole pine, as well as pinegrass, bunchberry and beautiful pink wild roses.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <strong>Wildlife:</strong>\n      Birds that thrive in this lakeside habitat include bald eagle, osprey and red-tailed hawk, as well as forest birds such as pileated woodpeckers, saw-whet owls, red crossbills, chickadees and nuthatches.\n      <br>\n      Because of the diversity in plant species, a wide variety of mammals lives in this area, from moose and black bears to humble shrews and chipmunks. There are also mule deer, pine martin, lynx, and flying squirrels.\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          <a href=\"/plan-your-trip/visit-responsibly/wildlife-safety\">\n            General Wildlife, Marine &amp; Outdoor Ethics Information</a>\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n</div>",

Prior to Lakelse Lake becoming a provincial park, Hatchery Creek, which runs throughout the park, was the site of a sockeye salmon hatchery operated by the Canadian Government between 1919 and 1936. Lakelse Lake Provincial Park was established on March 16, 1956.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Wildlife:</strong>\n      Within this old growth coastal forest, diverse wildlife populations and plant communities exist. The Kermodei bear, a white species of black bear, is native to the area. Coyote, moose, wolf, cougar, and many other mammals are also in the area.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      About 100 bird species have been counted in the area, including Canada geese, bald eagles, ospreys and trumpeter swans. This swan is the largest species of North American waterfowl and was once on the brink of extinction.

      "natureAndCulture": "<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>History:</strong>\n    Lakelse Lake Wetlands Provincial Park was designated as a park on May 20, 2004, following recommendations from the Kalum Land and Resource Management Plan.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Conservation:</strong>\n      Lakelse Lake Wetlands Park protects a biologically exceptional and Provincially significant warm-water wetland complex. Warm water springs in the Lakelse Lake Wetlands drain into Lakelse Lake, the largest warm water lake in northwestern BC. Clearwater and Andalas Creeks have open water throughout the winter. The streams are fed by warm water springs along an escarpment above the creeks.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The bog ecosystem in the Lakelse Lake Wetlands is regionally significant. It contains scattered and stunted Lodgepole Pine, Western Redcedar, and Western Hemlock. In addition to water loving shrubs and herbs, the bogs contain specialized plants such as sundews, tall white bog orchids and bog club-moss. Accumulations of moss and organic material are often greater than 100cm and water tables are within 20cm of the surface.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The south end of Lakelse Lake contains the most extensive cover of emergent and submerged aquatic plants remaining in Lakelse Lake. Dominant plants include Swamp horsetail in water to 1m and reeds in water to 4m in depth. The band of vegetation extends from Schulbuckhand Creek, on the east side of the park, to the outlet of the Lakelse River in the west. The aquatic vegetation has established on shallows built up by sediments from inflowing streams (Schulbuckhand, Clearwater, Andalas, and Ena Creeks). The aquatic vegetation is stabilized by the constant replenishment of sediments and nutrients that are carried in the streams.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The park also contains regionally significant valley bottom old growth stands. Valley bottom old growth in the Kitimat Valley is relatively rare and a special feature. Several small stands are located in the northwest corner, between Andalas and Clearwater Creek and on the southeast boundary of the park. Mature and old-growth forests commonly found on higher ground in the Lakelse Lake – Lakelse River area are very productive and contain Western hemlock, Sitka Spruce (largest trees in stand), and Western redcedar. Shrub cover is dense and is dominated by Devil’s Club, Salmonberry, and Oval-leaf huckleberry. Herbs are well developed, but the moss layer is thin.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Wildlife:</strong>\n    Lakelse Lake Wetlands Park contains internationally significant salmon spawning and rearing habitat and critical habitat for over-wintering steelhead. The large reed beds around the southern shoreline of Lakelse Lake and the streams that run through the alluvial fans and wetlands provide prime fish habitat. Steelhead over-winter in the reed beds. The warm water of Clearwater Creek support a late fall Coho run. Lakelse Lake and its tributaries are important to sockeye salmon. Sockeye salmon rear for a year within the lake prior to migrating to the sea the following April. Typically, 500,000 plus sockeye fry rear in the lake with 5-10,000 sockeye returning to the lake every fall. Although, in recent years as few as 1,000 adult spawners have returned. Consequently, Lakelse sockeye salmon are subject to a recovery strategy. The quality of water that drains through the wetlands is critical to the Lakelse River fishery. The water drains into the lake through the wetlands and out the Lakelse River, which drains from the southwest corner of the lake, approximately 0.5 km from the northern boundary of the park.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    The wetlands also contain regionally significant waterfowl habitat that is of great importance to migratory and over-wintering waterfowl. Trumpeter Swan (a provincially blue-listed/threatened species) over-winter and nest in the wetlands. There are reports of more than 100 swans wintering in the wetlands. Swans stay in the area from early winter to spring and breeding occurs in the wetlands. Geese and ducks feed and rest in the wetlands and in the reed beds at the south end of the lake.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    Grizzly and Black Bears use the corridor from Clearwater Lakes along Clearwater Creek to the wetlands. Grizzlies use the east side of the park in the spring (to feed on shrubs) and fall (to feed on salmon). One of the regions highest seasonal (fall) concentrations of Grizzlies is found along Clearwater Creek. Grizzly Bear density varies with the size of the salmon run. Historically there was a large seasonal population of Grizzly Bears in the wetland. Grizzlies were known to stay in the area until December, feeding on the late Coho runs in Coldwater Creek. Occasionally, after the late feeding, Grizzlies denned in the wetlands because snow accumulations prevented them from getting to their usual denning areas. The Cecil Creek drainage, west of the park, is a crossing zone for Grizzlies from four different populations. The Grizzly Bears breed in this area and cubs are often reared in the wetland.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    The wetlands are also an important seasonal habitat for Black Bear, Wolf, Beaver and other small furbearers. Some of the Black Bears in the area are subspecies Ursus americanus kermodei, (white phase). Black Bear use of the area is very high. The bears forage on Pacific Crab-apple and salmon.\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"/plan-your-trip/visit-responsibly/wildlife-safety\">\n          General Wildlife, Marine &amp; Outdoor Ethics Information</a>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>",

Here visitors can stroll through a network of trails under the shadow of towering ancient Douglas-fir trees, majestic pillars untouched by the modern world – some more than 800 years old.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Trails on either side of the highway lead visitors through the mighty stands of this coastal forest. On the south side you will find the largest Douglas firs – one measuring more than 9 metres in circumference. On the northern side of the road you’ll find groves of ancient Western red cedar standing sentry over nearby Cameron Lake.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The park has been restoring some of its trails after a severe windstorm on New Year’s Day in 1997, which changed the look of the park forever. The storm toppled hundreds of huge trees and obliterated sections of the trail system. Some sections of the trail system were so badly hit that they have never been reopened. Restoration and cleanup began almost as soon as the winds stopped, and although visitors will now find many of these huge trees lying on the ground, their value has not diminished. These fallen trees open the canopy to provide light, space, shelter and nutrients for the next generations of plants. Natural regeneration is beginning to restore the Grove’s pristine beauty and the park’s diversity, making a visit to Cathedral Grove all the more intriguing.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Improvements to MacMillan Park can be supported by “feeding” the donation tree next to the main trail; your contributions will be used for youth team trail projects, volunteer projects, revegetation projects and new signs. The park’s small size and accessibility has left it vulnerable to impacts from high visitor use. Please stay on designated trails, where you will find ample opportunities to view and photograph this bit of history.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Special Features:</strong>\n  The park protects and preserves an internationally significant representative example of Douglas fir old-growth forest within the Coastal Western Hemlock Biogeoclimatic Zone.\n</p>",

Cathedral Grove was a well-known tourist stop on the Alberni Road in the 1920s and 1930s when the timber was owned by the Victoria Lumbering and Manufacturing Company. For 15 years the public encouraged the provincial government to acquire the lands within Block 35, Cameron Lake area. The citizens’ organizations, The Associated Boards of Trade of Vancouver Island, petitioned the government in 1929 to preserve forever, for the public benefit, the well-known stand of timber at Cameron Lake, known as Cathedral Grove. In 1944 H.R. MacMillan, a well-known forester donated the 136 hectares of land for the perpetual enjoyment of the public in recognition of the unique stand of trees. Three years later, the area was established as a Class A provincial park.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Conservation:</strong>\n    The park protects and preserves an internationally significant representative example of Douglas fir old-growth forest within the East Vancouver Island and the Coastal Douglas fir Biogeoclimatic Zone.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Wildlife:</strong>\n    Many species of wildlife use the old-growth forest as their home including several types of woodpeckers, owls, insects, reptiles, amphibians, deer, elk, black bear and cougar.

It was established in 1974.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong>\n    The park lies within the asserted traditional territory of First Nations. Early explorers included Galiano and Valdes, who named Cortes Island after Hernando Cortes, the conqueror of Mexico.\n    <br>\n    In 1880, Michael Manson, an immigrant from Scotland established a trading post in the present park area to trade with First Nations and provide supplies to a slowly developing logging and fishing industry. A small general store was built on the trading post site but was moved in 1995 to a site adjacent to the community centre. This site now functions as a museum.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Conservation:</strong>\n    The natural features of the park, including Hague Lake, the sand spit and the lagoon, add significantly to the natural integrity of the island community.\n    <br>\n    All salmon species are found offshore and Hague Lake contains some Cutthroat trout. The lagoon provides opportunities to view oysters, clams, crabs, moon snails and nudibranches. Dominant trees include Douglas fir, Western red cedar, Arbutus, shore pine, red alder and broadleaf maple.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Wildlife:</strong>\n    Wildlife is transient and present only on occasion, the exceptions being red squirrels and ravens.

The geothermal hot springs cascade down a waterfall into half a dozen rocky pools. These pools flow from one level to the next becoming gradually cooler as the fresh spring water is cooled by ocean swells.Interpretive signs posted along the boardwalk to the hotsprings provideinformation about the geology and thermal features of the park.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Established Date:</strong>\n  January 7, 1955 for the park and July 7, 2004 for the Protected Area\n  <br>\n  <strong>Size:</strong>\n  Park – 2,667 hectares (1,269 ha upland, 1,398 ha foreshore); Protected Area – 53 hectares\n</p>",

Park visitors should wear good footwear and be mindful of the conditions when travelling in the park.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    The two kilometre\n    <strong>boardwalk to the hotsprings may not be suitable for all people</strong>. The boardwalk includes numerous sections of stairs and has many steps that could be physically challenging for some visitors. Access to the pools is through a rock strewn area and may also pose challenges due to the uneven footing.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Avoid times of high tides and high swells.</strong>\n    During winter high tides, the pools fill with cold sea water. Rough water and floating wood debris may cause bodily harm to bathers. Plan your visits to the springs to avoid times of high tides and high swells. Check with the tour operator, air carrier or water taxi before you start your trip.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Special Notes</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    There is a day-use fee of $3.00 per person per day.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Camping and fires are prohibited in the hot springs area\n    </strong>at the southern part of Openit Peninsula in the park.

If you are on the beach and feel strong shaking from an earthquake or if the water suddenly recedes, move immediately to higher ground (greater than 15 metres or 45 feet above the tide line). There is no way to be certain how high a tsunami is going to be. The first wave to arrive at the coast is often not the largest, and each wave may be separated by up to an hour or more. Waves may continue for up to twelve hours, so you must stay on high ground until advised otherwise.

Under the Cariboo-Chilcotin Land-use Plan, uses that were permitted before 1995 will continue in the park: livestock grazing, hunting, trapping and guiding. In 2013, 2,215 hectares were added to the park as part of the Cariboo-Chilcotin Land-use Plan (special feature) process.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Cultural Heritage</strong>\n    - Marble Range Park is within the traditional territory of the Shuswap People. Three First Nations continue to use the park for sustenance, spiritual and cultural purposes. If you find any First Nations heritage sites, do not disturb them or remove anything - they are protected under the\n    <em>\n      Heritage Conservation Act.\n    </em>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Conservation</strong>\n    - The principal reasons for the protection of the Marble Range area were for: the preservation of alpine and subalpine habitats in the Pavillion Ranges Ecosection (PAR), the preservation of endangered and non-endangered wildlife and their habitat (e.g., bighorn sheep, mule deer and cougar) and for high back-country recreation values. The park is located within the Pavilion Ranges, and protects mostly mid- to high elevation ecosystems. The forests contain old growth Douglas-fir, spruce, lodgepole and whitebark pine, ranging into subalpine parklands and extensive alpine tundra. The karst topography is unusual in BC, and is protected in only a few other parks, mostly on Vancouver Island. Soils in the area are high in calcium, so they support a number of rare plants.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Wildlife</strong>\n    - Wildlife viewing is popular in the Marble Range. Please remember your binoculars and telephoto lenses, as keeping your distance will minimize disturbance to the California bighorn sheep and other animals. The park, along with the nearby\n    <a href=\"../edge_hills/\" class=\"legacy-link\">\n      Edge Hills Park</a>\n    provides important habitat for species that require large, diverse ecosystems, such as cougar and black bear. The Marble Range is excellent as mule deer summer range. Every year, California bighorn sheep migrate between alpine areas in the Marble Range and steep cliffs of the Fraser River canyon in Edge Hills Provincial Park. The migration is dictated by food availability. Sheep will winter in the warmth of the canyon, where tender green shoots begin to grow early in the season. Here, the sheep also encounter less snow, and have access to steep and rugged terrain for protection from predators. In early summer, the sheep migrate to alpine areas in the Marble Range. Over the past 40 to 50 years, many of these routes have been abandoned, with only a few routes remaining. A three year study has been initiated by the Clinton and District Outdoor Sportsmen Association in order to determine exactly where the migration routes are. The results will assist in future management decisions.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"/plan-your-trip/visit-responsibly/wildlife-safety\">\n      General Wildlife, Marine &amp; Outdoor Ethics Information</a>\n  </li>\n</ul>",

Lower elevations are noted for stands of coastal western hemlock and interior Douglas fir. Englemann Spruce, subalpine fir, mountain hemlock, and lodgepole pine can be found at higher elevations, and above those, alpine tundra. Many of the stands in the subalpine environment are old growth forests. The portion of the creek below the falls protects Chinook, bull trout and rainbow trout spawning and rearing habitat. Portions of the park are an important breeding and nesting habitat for harlequin duck.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Wildlife:</strong>\n    In combination with the Nahatlatch and Stein protected areas, Mehatl Creek Provincial Park offers habitat for species that are dependent on old-growth ecosystems and a high degree of wilderness.

Shot and edited by Mike McKinlay and narrated by MIST volunteer Kate Rubin.\n  </p>\n</div>\n<p>\n  Mitlenatch Island Nature Provincial Park is home to the largest seabird colony in the Strait of Georgia. All sedentary marine life, including abalones, scallops and sea cucumbers, are fully protected within the park’s boundaries, which extend 300 metres out from the shore. This nature reserve is an important nesting colony for thousands of Glaucous-winged Gulls, as well as Pelagic Cormorants, Pigeon Guillemots, Black Oystercatchers and many other species of birds. Marine life around the island includes river otters and harbour seals throughout the year, and Steller’s and California sea lions from late fall through to summer.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Mitlenatch, which means “calm waters all around” in the Coast Salish language, is a small rocky island that features semi-arid conditions caused by the island’s location in the “rain shadow” of Vancouver Island. The park receives less than 75 cm (30 inches) of rain each year – about half the Campbell River average. Rain-bearing clouds pass eastward from the Pacific Ocean and drop much of their moisture on Vancouver Island. As they descend across the Strait of Georgia, they warm and pick up new moisture, which will be dropped on the Coast Mountains of mainland British Columbia.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Accessible only by boat, Mitlenatch Island Nature Provincial Park offers excellent opportunities to observe and photograph wildflowers and birds. Visit in May when the island’s meadows of spring wildflowers are in bloom, or in late May to July when the harvest brodia blooms and in the last half of June when the coastal cactus bloom. Birders should approach the observation blind as a group, slowly and quietly, this may help to reduce the birds’ anxiety and allow you to observe their behaviour and “family life” more easily.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The island is a very sensitive ecosystem that is extremely prone to damage by visitors who venture off the designated trails.

The Rocky Mountains and Prairies did not exist and the land was inhabited with dinosaurs such as tyrannosaurus, anklyosaurus, triceratops, parasaurolophus, elasmosaurus and pteranodon.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Moberly Lake held a special meaning to the Dane-zaa First Nations people, as it was known to them as “the lake you can depend on.” It meant that the people could always return to Moberly Lake since food sources there were always plentiful and reliable.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      To some of the Dane-zaa First Nations, Moberly Lake held another mystery. It was also known as “the lake with a hole through it” or “the lake with no bottom.” There is a legend that is often told of an ancient creature that surfaces from time to time a long, long time ago.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The lake was named for Harry Moberly, chief trader with the Hudson’s Bay Company. He left the Company in 1865 and settled down on the north shore of Moberly Lake until 1868. In 1870, he rejoined the Company to complete a total of 37 years of faithful service.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Conservation:</strong>\n    Moberly Provincial Park is covered with a fairly dense stand of white spruce interspersed with trembling aspen and balsam poplar. Large cottonwoods occupy much of the low lying areas.

Smaller mammals like the red squirrel, snowshoe hare, muskrat and beaver are more likely to be seen. More than 25 species of birds including the common loon, bald eagle, American kestrel, spotted sandpiper, herring gull and belted kingfisher have been recorded in the park.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Moberly Lake and the Peace River district are very special areas for songbirds.

Monkman Park was established in 1981. An additional 22,000 hectares were added in 1999 to protect the Limestone Lakes and Upper Fontiniko Creek Valley areas. This addition protects old-growth spruce forests, unique geological formations and important recreation.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The park has a diverse water system that includes the Murray and Monkman drainages.

The northern section of Monkman Provincial Park features\n  <a href=\"camp-hike#kinuseo\">\n    Kinuseo Falls</a>, where the Murray River plunges 60 metres over a geological fault to the river bed below. This thunderous cascade of water is higher than Niagara Falls and provides many visitors with the highlight of their trip. Despite the rugged grandeur of the park, prime areas of it can be easily accessed--there is even a wheelchair-accessible platform affording great views of the Falls and horseshoe pits at the nearby campsite.

      "natureAndCulture": "<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>History:</strong>\n    Monkman Provincial Park was named after Alex Monkman, an individual who expended a considerable amount of effort attempting to build a transportation route from the Peace River farming country down to the Pacific ports. In 1922, he and a group of fur trappers discovered what is now known as Monkman Pass. It was this pass that provided him with his vision for a railroad, a direct and economical route south. Failing to get government support for his venture, Monkman focused on the alternative--building a highway. The Monkman Pass Highway Association was formed in 1936, and over the next three years, many determined volunteers laboured to blaze this new trail. Limited funding, harsh conditions, and the outbreak of the Second World War eventually brought the project to a halt. A railway was later built to the northwest over the Pine Pass, and Monkman’s “highway” slowly faded into historical obscurity. Today, only a few sections are visible along the\n    <a href=\"camp-hike#trail\">\n      Monkman Lake Trail</a>, a route that follows parts of the original road. The Brooks Falls in Monkman Provincial Park, was named after Carl Brooks, one of the volunteers who worked along with Alex Monkman and the Highway Association. A cairn marking overlooking the falls has been placed in his honour.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Conservation:</strong>\n    Lower elevations in the park are dominated by mature sub-alpine fir, white spruce and lodgepole pine. The higher elevations support growths of Englemann spruce, sub-alpine fir and white spruce. Above the treeline, only plants adapted to the conditions are to be found. Monkman Provincial Park conserves representative areas of the Central Rocky Mountains and Foothills. Lower elevations in the park are dominated by mature sub-alpine fir, white spruce and lodgepole pine. The higher elevations support growth of Engelmann spruce, sub-alpine fir and white spruce. Above treeline, the trees become dwarfed and twisted. Alpine meadows of heathers, grasses and wildflowers, such as white rhododendron, arctic lupine, glacier lily and Indian paintbrush cover large areas and are intermixed with shrubs.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Wildlife:</strong>\n      The diverse range of habitat in Monkman Provincial Park supports grizzly and black bear, mountain goats, caribou and moose. During the warmer seasons, deer, mountain sheep, gray wolves, fishers, martens, wolverines, marmots, hares, and red squirrels are joined by numerous bird species that include owls, ptarmigan, grouse, geese and loons. Because of the fierce winter climate, most of the larger animals tend to seek a more hospitable range during the winter months.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"camp-hike#kinuseo\">\n        Kinuseo Falls</a>\n      presents an impassable obstacle to migrating fish, so fish habitat is not the same above and below the falls. Larger fish are able to follow the Murray River drainage from lower elevations to the falls. Above the falls, only small char, trout, grayling and whitefish inhabit the Murray River and upper Monkman Creek.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n</ul>",

      "description": "<p>\n  Montague Harbour Marine Provincial Park on peaceful Galiano Island is rich in natural and cultural history. White shell beaches, open meadows, tidal lagoons, towering forests, craggy headlands and abundant bird life are just a few of the things that attract visitors to this park in the southern Gulf Islands.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The park starts five metres below sea level and climbs 180 metres to a steep rocky precipice. Visitors can moor their boats to one of the 35 buoys in sheltered Montague Harbour or come by ferry and camp in one of the scenic vehicle-accessible or walk-in campsites. The park is the perfect place to enjoy a picnic or afternoon of exploration. Located within the park is Gray Peninsula, which was inhabited by First Nations peoples before the arrival of Spanish explorer Dionisio Galiano in 1792. Skirting the northwest edge of the peninsula is a spectacular rock ledge that was carved into rippling patterns by the movement of glaciers thousands of years ago.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Montague Harbour, with its sheltered waters and abundant salmon and shellfish, is heir to a rich history. The white shell beach on the north side of the park marks one of several shell middens – evidence of native occupation dating back more than 3,000 years. Castaway shells left by centuries of harvesting form berms on the foreshore in many areas of the park. Wave action erodes the middens, crushes the shells and redeposits them to create Montague’s white shell beaches. Archaeological excavations of these protected middens have unearthed arrows, spearheads and stone carvings, helping to unravel the stories of earlier cultures.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Montague Harbour is a delight for outdoor enthusiasts and nature lovers in any season, but particularly during the long hot days of summer. Naturalists and bird watchers enjoy a climate and ecology found nowhere else, making Galiano Island a haven for many rare and protected plants and more than 130 species of birds. The waters around Montague Harbour attract flocks of wintering birds including diving ducks like scoters, buffleheads, goldeneyes and mergansers.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Special Features:</strong>\n  On the northwest edge of Gray Peninsula is a spectacular rock ledge that was carved into rippling patterns by the movement of glaciers thousands of years ago. The park also features a salt water marsh between the main campground and Gray Peninsula, and evidence of First Nations culture that dates back more than 3,000 years. Middens are located in the north side of the park and in the harbour.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Special Notes:</strong>\n  <br>\n  Middens are protected under BC law. Do not disturb these archaeological sites. Help protect them by accessing the beach using the stairs where ever possible.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In your exploration, please remember to carefully replace overturned rocks in their original position.

Montague Harbour, named for a naval officer, first appeared on a British surveying chart around 1859. Gray Peninsula was settled in the late 1890s by Captain Gray, who cultivated an orchard that supplied fruit to residents in Victoria. Remnants of this old orchard can still be found.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Conservation:</strong>\n    Montague Park is rimmed by diverse shoreline – on the open shore, the shifting surface of sand and shells prevents large plants and animals from making their homes. Acorn barnacles grow in intertidal zones, together with the giant barnacle, edible mussel and Japanese oyster. At low tide scores of ochre sea stars can be seen on the rocks, feeding on barnacles, mussels and sea snails such as the whelk and periwinkle.\n    <br>\n    A rich habitat of flora and fauna can be viewed in the small salt marsh on Gray’s Peninsula. A lush mixture of Douglas fir, western red cedar, grand fir and arbutus characterize the park. Skirting the northwest of the peninsula is a spectacular rock ledge that thousands of years ago was carved into rippling patterns by the movement of glaciers.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Wildlife:</strong>\n    The forest, rocky coastline and rich tidal lagoon attract many birds year-round. Great Blue Herons, glaucous-winged gulls, black oystercatchers, northwestern crows, belted kingfisher and bald eagles can often be seen scavenging and soaring over the seas in search of a meal. Horse clams, littleneck clams and butter clams find a safe sanctuary by burrowing beneath the shifting sands on the open shore.\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"/plan-your-trip/visit-responsibly/wildlife-safety\">\n          General Wildlife, Marine &amp; Outdoor Ethics Information</a>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>",

      "description": "<p>\n  Moose Valley Provincial Park comprises 2,322 hectares of rolling landscape scattered with lakes and wetlands. The area was proposed for protection through the Cariboo public CORE process, and was originally designated a park through the Cariboo Chilcotin Land Use Plan in 1995. The park protects a chain of 12 small lakes, popular as a day or overnight canoeing destination. It is an idyllic place to visit, rewarding paddlers with clear, shallow lakes and abundant aquatic plants and flowers. The many tiny reed-fringed islands and surrounding marshes provide excellent habitat for deer, moose, waterfowl and amphibians.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Stuart Maitland, a local guide outfitter, first cleared and named portages linking the main lakes in the\n  <a href=\"canoe\">\n    Moose Valley Canoe Chain</a>\n  in the early 1970s, with assistance from Hugh Kirkland and Kevin Marks. These three ambitious young men were in their late teens at the time, and independently sought government assistance to do the work. Today, the three main lakes in the chain are named after the youth who first developed the route. The route was later upgraded in 1987/88 by youth members of the Provincial Job Trac program.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The park is a wonderful place to spend leisure time canoeing, bird-watching, and wildlife viewing. Canoeing along the\n  <a href=\"canoe\">\n    Moose Valley Canoe Chain</a>\n  is the primary recreational activity, and both day and overnight trips are popular. Camping areas are available at either end of the canoe route, but the only developed sites are located at the main access point at Marks Lake and at the north end of Maitland Lake. While the 1100 Road into Moose Valley isn’t maintained in winter, the area is still a haven for cross-country skiing and snow-shoeing. A local outfitter offers one to two-day dog sled tours in the winter and guided canoe trips in the park.\n</p>\n<h4>Special Features</h4>\n<p>\n  Wetlands and sphagnum bogs can be accessed and viewed via canoe.\n  <br>\n</p>",

      "natureAndCulture": "<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>History:</strong>\n    The name Morice Lake was adopted in the 9th Report of the Geographic Board of Canada in 1910 in association with the Morice River which drains the lake. The lake was named after the Rev. Father Adrien-Gabriel Morice, author of “The History of the Northern Interior of British Columbia,” which describes his 20 years of explorations and missionary work in this area of the province.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    The traditional Wet’suwet’en name is Wet-zuhn-buhn (pronounced wet-zin-bun), meaning the “blueish-green colour of the water.” Morice River is called Wet-zuhn-kwa. In the Wet’suwet’en language “Kwa” refers to a river or stream, and “buhn” refers to a body of water like a lake.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    The park is one of seven new parks and protected areas resulting from the Morice Land and Resource Management Plan (LRMP) and associated government-to-government discussions with the Office of the Wet’suwet’en. Legislation of the park occurred in July, 2008.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Culture:</strong>\n    Morice Lake Provincial Park is located within the traditional territory of the Wet’suwet’en First Nation. Known as the people of the lower drainage, the Wet’suwet’en have been living in this part of the continent since time immemorial. The park lies in the Lhudis Bin and C’iniggit Nenikëkh house territories within the Wet’suwet’en territory. The Lhudis Bin house territory is in the house of Cas yex (Grizzly House) that belongs to the Gitdumden (Bear/Wolf) clan. The C’iniggit Nenikëkh house territory is in the house of Yextsowiten (Thin House) that belongs to the Gilseyhyu (Big Frog) clan.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Conservation:</strong>\n    The conservation role of Morice Lake Park is to protect:\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        Water quality, fish habitat and fish populations at the headwaters of an important salmon and steelhead river.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Wildlife (Grizzly bears, mountain goats, moose, deer, caribou).\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Habitat for wildlife within the park and the adjacent land-base of the Morice River watershed.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Old growth forests.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Rare whitebark pine ecosystems.\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    The lake provides important rearing habitat for the Nanika River sockeye stock and has resident populations of rainbow and lake trout, Dolly Varden, burbot and kokanee. The upper reaches of the Morice River provides important spawning habitat for Chinook salmon.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    Forests in the park reflect a transition from interior types in the east, to coastal types in the west. The park also contains good quality Grizzly Bear habitat, riparian and wetland ecosystems, rare whitebark pine ecosystems, and blue-listed Bull Trout. The high fisheries values in Morice Lake Park are integral to the Wet’suwet’en people, indicated by the many archaeological sites occurring along the lake.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    Morice Lake Provincial Park also provides important ecosystem services (the benefits that people receive from ecosystems) that include clean water, natural flood control, carbon storage, air purification, nutrient cycling, food, biodiversity, recreation, aesthetic experience and spiritual experience. Morice Lake plays an important role in regulating water quantity, water temperature, and release of spring melt waters, which is important for both fish habitat and downstream water users.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Wildlife:</strong>\n    This is a wilderness Park and many species of wildlife are prevalent and widespread. Larger species include: grizzly bears, black bears, mountain goats, moose, deer, and caribou. Please do not approach animals, allow plenty of space during viewing opportunites.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    Smaller species you may encounter include: hoary marmots, wolverines, and Siberian lemmings as well as various bird species, including willow ptarmigans, gray-crowned rosy finches and golden-crowned sparrows. Members of the grouse family occur in considerable numbers and waterfowl are usually plentiful in the lakes.\n  </li>\n</ul>",

      "description": "<p>\n  Mount Edziza Provincial Park encompasses over 230,000 hectares of the Tahltan Highlands in northwestern British Columbia. This remote park showcases a spectacular volcanic landscape that includes lava flows, basalt plateaus, cinder fields and cinder cones.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Mount Edziza itself, (peak elevation 2,787 meters) is a composite volcano consisting of thin basalt flows and a central dome of andesite, dacite and rhyolite with a glaciated crater nearly 2,500 meters in diameter. The eruption that built the mountain and its central cone began approxmiately four million years ago. Successive lava flows raised the dome above the encircling plateau and spread lava over an area 65 kilometers by 25 kilometers. The last basalt flow occurred only 10,000 years ago, at which time it solidified in place and plugged the central vent.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In the years since Mount Edziza became dormant, numerous small eruptions have taken place around it, creating more than 30 cinder cones. Perfectly symmetrical Eve Cone rises 150 meters above the plateau, as do Coffee and Cocoa craters, aptly named for their deep colours. It is estimated that these cones were formed no more than 1,300 years ago and are basically unaltered by erosion.\n</p>\n<p>\n  There are also five lakes of significant size within the park. Mowdade, Mowchilla, Kakiddi and Nuttlude form a chain along the eastern boundary, while Buckley Lake is on the northern border. All the lakes except Mowdade drain north into the Klastline River, a tributary of the Stikine.\n</p>\n<p>\n  To the south, Raspberry Pass separates the Edziza area from the Spectrum Range. Formed from lava flows, these mountains are named for their brilliant red, yellow, white and purple rock. This altered rhyolite resulted from staining by sulphurous mineral waters. Subsequent erosion has resulted in the combination of many hues, giving the landscape the appearance of a vast water colour. There is no vehicle access to Mount Edziza Provincial Park, and there are only a very few basic facilities.

In an effort to minimize disturbance to wildlife, please maintain a distance of more than 1,500m line of sight/500m vertical from all wildlife and use terrain masking techniques where the weather conditions make this impossible. Take offs/landings are not permitted on sensitive areas (i.e. lava flows, calcite deposits, hot springs etc.) and volcanic cones/features throughout the Park. Park visitors should report any obvious signs of aircraft disregard or damage (i.e. tire tracks, skid tracks, rotor wash damage etc.) to sensitive areas and volcanic cones/features. Observations and/or photos can be submitted to the BC Parks Stikine Area office on Telegraph Creek Road, or via telephone at 250 771-4591.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Horses</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    A Letter of Authorization (LOA) is required for visitors who wish to use horses within Mount Edziza Provincial Park. There is a mandatory “weed-free feed” requirement for any horses entering the northern parks, meaning that horses must be fed certified weed-free pellets for 72 hours prior to entering the park and throughout the duration of their stay within the park. The primary reason for the weed-free feed requirement is the growing concern of introducing invasive plant species (either through non-permitted feed or horse droppings) into a natural and pristine ecosystem in the park. To obtain an LOA, please contact the BC Parks Stikine Senior Park Ranger at 250 771-4591 ext.2. If there is no answer, please leave a detailed message stating your request for an LOA, your name, contact information and the date you wish to visit the park.\n  </li>\n</ul>",

      "natureAndCulture": "<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>History:</strong>\n    On the east bank of Mess Creek and through Raspberry Pass are the remnants of the Yukon Telegraph line which was constructed to provide a communications link as far north as Dawson City during the Klondike Gold Rush. The telegraph line was in use until 1936 when it was replaced by radio.All that remains are a few poles and collapsed line cabins which once stood every 32 kilometres along the route.\n    <strong>The trail is overgrown and no longer passable.</strong>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong>\n    Since time immemorial, the area was heavily used by Indigenous peoples, who manufactured obsidian cutting blades and projectile points and traded them throughout northwest America. The area is still culturally significant for the Tahltan Nation today. Archaeological finds (including obsidian, tools, and other artifacts) are to be left in place and reported to the local BC Parks or Tahltan Central Government office.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Conservation:</strong>\n    Along the park’s western boundary, Mess Creek flows north to enter the Stikine River three kilometres below the community of Telegraph Creek. Eleven kilometres upstream from this confluence, Mess Creek plunges into a gorge nearly 800 metres deep. To the north of the park boundary, the Stikine River, which means \"Great River\" in the language of the Tlingit, has carved a tremendous, Grand Canyon-style passage through eons of volcanic and sedimentary rock deposits. Tree types and vegetation will change with elevations. Telegraph Creek to Buckley Lake area is characterized by a mosaic of shrub fields, wet grasslands and peat meadows. This zone has long, severe winters with deeply frozen soils and short growing seasons. The forests in the lower elevation valleys, Mess Creek and the Kakiddi/Klastline drainage are composed of white spruce as the dominant conifer with an intermixing of lodgepole pine and trembling aspen on the drier sites. On the wetter sites, balsam poplar is also found, often adjacent to creeks, lakes and on delta soils. At elevation between 900 and 1800 metres, the winters are cold and snowy, the summers are short and warm. The soils in this area are commonly frozen before snowfall.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Wildlife:</strong>\n    Moose populate the area, and small herds of Osborn caribou may be seen in the alpine and sub-alpine vegetation zones on the west side of the plateau between Mount Edziza and the western escarpment. Mountain goats and Stone’s sheep can often be viewed on the south, east and west slopes of Mount Edziza, particularly on the western escarpment and in the Spectrum Range. Visitors may encounter black and grizzly bears. Grizzlies are occasionally seen above timberline where Arctic ground squirrels are abundant. Wolves are sometimes seen or heard. Buckley Lake supports a large waterfowl and shorebird population, which are but a portion of the wide variety of bird species that can be seen in the park.

The campaign to establish Mount Erskine Provincial Park was supported by many individuals, local businesses, and non-government organizations.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Culture:</strong>\n      Mount Erskine Provincial Park is within the traditional territory of the Chemainus First Nation, Cowichan Tribes, Halalt First Nation, Lake Cowichan First Nation, Lyackson First Nation and Penelakut First Nation (all members of the Hul qumi num Treaty Group) and the Tsawwassen First Nation. The west side of Salt Spring Island from Burgoyne Bay to Vesuvius Bay was part of the traditional summer gathering area for the Cowichan Tribes. There are no recorded archaeological sites in the park.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Europeans first settled the area in the mid-1800s. Mount Erskine was named around 1859 by Captain George Richards of the British Royal Navy and labelled as such on British Admiralty Chart 2840, 1861. The name honours Admiral Elphinstone Erskine, who was then Commander-in-Chief of the North American Squadron. Captain Richards named several of the mountains in the area while conducting surveys for the British Admiralty along the west coast of Canada during 1858-1860.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Early recorded settlers to this isolated part of Salt Spring Island included many solitary bachelors like Charlie and Albert Toynbee, uncles of well-known islanders Dick, Manson, and Tom Toynbee. Charlie and Albert were thought to have lived in a cabin on the southeast edge of Mount Erskine Provincial Park, not far from the end of present-day Toynbee Road.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Conservation:</strong>\n    Mount Erskine Provincial Park supports a unique series of ecosystem types that have very restricted distribution on Salt Spring Island. All but the western-most side of the park is within the Coastal Western Hemlock Biogeoclimatic Zone [CWH] although, in most of this ecosystem, Douglas fir is the dominant tree species. A very small section of the park is in the Coastal Douglas Fir [CDF] and is characterized largely by Douglas fir and western red cedar forests and the occasional grand fir. In addition, the park preserves an excellent example of the red-listed arbutus/hairy manzanita plant community as well as other species and habitats at risk.\n  </li>\n</ul>",

      "description": "<blockquote>\n  <em>\n    “On every side the snowy heads of mighty hills crowded round, whilst, immediately behind us, a giant among giants, and immeasurably supreme, rose Robson’s Peak” (Milton and Cheadle, 1865)\n  </em>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n  Mount Robson Provincial Park, the second oldest park in British Columbia’s park system, is truly one of the world’s crown jewels. The mountain for which the park is named guards the park’s western entrance. At 3,954 metres, Mount Robson, the highest peak in the Canadian Rockies, towers over the lesser surrounding peaks; winter or summer, this is one of the finest&nbsp;views in the Rocky Mountains. Just as the early trappers, hunters and explorers felt in awe at the mountain’s magnificence, travellers today experience the same feelings.\n</p>\n<p>\n  With Alberta’s Jasper National Park as its easterly neighbour, Mount Robson Provincial Park comprises a portion of one of the world’s largest blocks of protected areas. Designated as a part of the\n  <a href=\"http://whc.unesco.org/sites/304.htm\">\n    Canadian Rocky Mountains World Heritage Site</a>\n  by UNESCO in 1990, Mount Robson provides everything from developed, vehicle-accessible camping to remote valleys that seldom see a human footprint. Mount Robson Provincial Park also protects the headwaters of the Fraser River. From its pristine alpine source, the Fraser River gains strength and size to match any of the world’s major rivers. Future genations will surely appreciate the protection of this great river’s source within Mount Robson Park.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Flora and fauna are typical of the western slope of the Rocky Mountains, North Continental Range. One is able, on some trails, to travel between three different vegetation zones during a day hike. Over 182 species of birds have been documented in the park. All wildlife indigenous in the Rocky Mountain can be found here. Mule and Whitetail Deer, Moose, Elk and Black Bear call the lower elevation home while Grizzly Bear, Caribou, Mountain Goat and Mountain Sheep inhabit the higher elevations. With over 217,000 hectares of mostly undisturbed wilderness available, wildlife populations are allowed to ebb and flow with minimal intervention by humans. There are excellent wildlife viewing opportunities throughout the park. From mountain goats on the many cliffs and rockslides to moose in Moose Marsh, the patient observer will be suitably rewarded.\n</p>\n<p>\n  First attempted in 1907, it was not until 1913 that humans finally stood on the summit of Mount Robson. On that clear, cold day guide Conrad Kain, W.W. Foster and A.H. McCarthy beheld a view no person had ever seen before.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For 20 years, the Mountain Legacy Project (MLP), based today in the School of Environmental Studies at the University of Victoria, has been using repeat photography to examine, analyze, and understand landscape level change in the Canadian mountain west. Mt. Robson Provincial Park, with over 3 kilometres of elevation change from the valley of the Fraser River (approximately 800 m.) to the summit of Mt. Robson (3954 m), and four biogeoclimatic zones, represents a series of interconnected complex mountain ecosystems perfect for landscape level analysis. This park, with an area of roughly 2,250 km², may appear imperishable, but change is evident. Using reference photographs taken in 1911 by Arthur Wheeler, MLP teams went out in the field 100 years later to retake the images from exactly the same locations. All of the historic/modern image pairs so far completed can be seen online at\n  <a href=\"http://explore.mountainlegacy.ca/\">\n    explore.mountainlegacy.ca</a>. A selected group of image pairs were further segmented into land cover classifications and analyzed for change. The results, including some interesting interactive change visualizations, are available at the\n  <a href=\"https://robsonlandscape.weebly.com/\">\n    Visualizing 100 Years of Landscape Change website</a>. This work was completed in part through funding provided through the BC Parks\n  <a href=\"/conservation/living-lab-program\">\n    Living Lab for Climate Change and Conservation Program</a>.\n</p>",

      "natureAndCulture": "<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      <strong>History:</strong>\n      Established in 1936, the park was named for Frederick Seymour, Governor of British Columbia from 1864 to 1869. Although the first recorded climb of Mount Seymour was made in 1908 by a party from the BC Mountaineering Club, Mount Seymour was virtually unknown to most of the residents of Vancouver and vicinity until the late 1920&amp;rsquo;s. In 1929, members of the Alpine Club of Canada explored the mountain as a potential skiing area and the following year applied for a 21 year lease covering the primary skiing terrain, however the Depression years forced the club to drop the lease. In 1984 the Controlled Recreation Area and its facilities was awarded to Mt. Seymour Resorts Ltd. under a Park Use Permit.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Conservation:</strong>\n      The park lies in the coastal western hemlock and mountain hemlock biogeoclimatic zones. Below 1,000 metres, old-growth Douglas-fir and western red cedar are interspersed with second-growth coniferous and deciduous trees and a variety of shrubs. At 1,000 metres and above, forest cover is mostly amabilis fir, yellow cedar and mountain hemlock. Some of the higher meadows are cloaked with sub-alpine flowers, providing colourful early summer displays.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Wildlife:</strong>\n      A variety of large and small mammals inhabit the park. Coyotes and deer are often seen close to the access road. Black bears, bobcats or cougars may be sighted in the backcountry. It must be strongly emphasized that bears, cougars and bobcats are wild animals and should never be approached, offered food or tormented.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Among the smaller species and birds to be found in the park are varying hare, Douglas squirrel and pine marten. The Canada jay, identified by its raucous call and social manners, is a frequent visitor to hikers’ lunching spots. Other indigenous birds include the raven, Steller’s jay (the official bird of British Columbia), chickadee, kinglet, sapsucker, grouse and siskin. During their annual fall migration, several species of hawks may be spotted.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n</ul>",

It roughly encompasses KLO Creek to Bellevue Creek and up to Saucier Creek and Canyon Lake with a large exclusion in the centre that locals refer to as the “donut.” The upper portions of Pooley Creek are also excluded. There are two accesses off of McCulloch Road.\n</p>\n<h5>\n  Myra (the main access)\n</h5>\n<p>\n  Follow McCulloch Road past the golf course to the Myra Forest Service Road. Use caution since this section of paved road is narrow with blind corners. Once on the forest service road, follow it for 8 km to the large parking area. The road is gravel and can be rough. The gravel parking area is divided into two lots with a total of roughly 75 spots and lots of room to turn around. There are two pit toilets here, one of which is wheelchair-accessible. There is no parking beyond this point. Motorized vehicles are prohibited past this access to Myra Canyon.\n</p>\n<h5>\n  June Springs\n</h5>\n<p>\n  The other access is via the paved June Springs Road. Follow it for 6 km to the Little White Forest Service Road. Follow the unpaved forest service road for 4.5 km to the parking area. This road is also rough and passes through private property. There is a gravel parking area for roughly 33 vehicles and one pit toilet above the parking lot. Further along the rail bed there is more parking. At kilometre 1 there are two narrow pullouts, with 11 spots and 21 spots, and two pit toilets. There is no parking beyond this point. Motorized vehicles are prohibited past this access to Myra Canyon. Use extreme caution when driving around hikers and bikers on the road in.\n</p>\n<h5>\n  Stewart Road East\n</h5>\n<p>\n  This road accesses the lower elevation portion of the protected area popular with mountain bikers. It is unique in that it is so close to the urban area of Kelowna. In Kelowna, follow Benvoulin Road to Casorso Road to Bedford Road to Stewart Road East and the parking lot where there are two pit toilets.\n</p>",

      "natureAndCulture": "<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      <strong>History:</strong>\n      The name Na-di-na Mountain first appeared on the 1879 Geological Survey of Canada map of BC &amp; NWT. Nadina means \"standing up alone\" in the Wet’suwet’en language, referring to the prominent, solitary aspect of the mountain.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      This park is one of seven new parks and protected areas resulting from the Morice Land and Resource Management Plan (LRMP) and associated government-to-government discussions with the Office of the Wet’suwet’en. Legislation of the park occurred in July, 2008.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Culture:</strong>\n    Located within the Wet’suwet’en First Nation traditional territory, Nadina Mountain Park is in the Bi Wini house territory, in the house of Keexwinits (House in the Middle of Many) that belongs to the Gitdumden (Bear/Wolf) clan. Naydeena (Nadina) Mountain is a place where Wet’suwet’en people would go to hunt caribou, dutney (groundhog or marmot) and klayyul (mountain goat). Caribou would be snared, with the snare tied to a piece of wood. The wood would be dragged around after the caribou was caught in the snare. When the animal tired of towing the wood or the wood was tangled in trees or rocks it was harvested with spears or arrows.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Conservation:</strong>\n    The conservation role of Nadina Mountain Park is to protect a unique isolated granitic mountain and its associated natural values, including:\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        Mountain goats\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Grizzly bears\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Lichen communities\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Granitic spires\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>\n      Nadina Mountain Park provides important habitat for wildlife that live in and around the park. Mountain goats from Nadina Mountain may disperse to other nearby areas such as Poplar Mountain, Morice Mountain, and Foxy Creek.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Vegetation below tree line is primarily subalpine fir although rare whitebark pine ecosystems also occur. The expansive alpine tundra has a diverse community of lichen species. Most of the low elevation northwest portion of the park consists of wetland habitat.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Nadina Mountain Park also provides important ecosystem services (the benefits that people receive from ecosystems) that include clean water, natural flood control, carbon storage, air purification, nutrient cycling, food, biodiversity, recreation, aesthetic experience and spiritual experience.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Wildlife:</strong>\n    A significant population of mountain goats make Nadina Mountain their home. Tufts of goat hair are to be found on rocks along the route to the summit and viewing opportunities are plentiful. Do not approach or attempt to feed the goats, please maintain a respectful distance. Other species commonly observed in the area are black bear, ground squirrels, marmots and deer. Park users should always be aware of bears and other wildlife in our park environment. Never feed or approach bears or other wildlife.\n  </li>\n</ul>",

The park offers visitors a chance to explore many unique and interesting features of a volcanic landscape and to learn about the culture and legends of the Nisg̱a’a people.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Just outside of the park, there are five communities, four of which are Nisg̱a’a villages. Their names are Gitlakdamix (New Aiyansh), Gitwinksihlkw (Canyon City), Lakalzap (Greenville), Kincolith and Nass Camp. All communities are road accessible from the park.

Nisg̱a’a Memorial Lava Bed Park is also the first provincial park to be jointly managed by a First Nation and BC Parks.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The Nisg̱a’a alkali basalt flow is one of the youngest and most accessible volcanic features in British Columbia. The guided volcanic tours offer the park visitor a chance to hike 3 km through a scenic old growth forest and past a variety of volcanic features to a viewpoint overlooking the crater. To protect the special features of the area, unguided access to the volcanic cone is prohibited. The hike is rated as moderate with some hills and steep stairs.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Geological History:</strong>\n  As the lava spilled from the crater an estimated 250 years ago, it followed a creek bed downslope to Lava Lake and down the Tseax Valley to the Nass River. The lava travelled at different speeds depending on the steepness of the slope. Some types of lava flow and interesting features include:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Tree cast – formed by burned out tree trunks leaving holes in the lava.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Lava tube – formed as the top layer cooled and hardened. The crust insulated the lava flowing inside which eventually flowed out leaving the crust as the roof and walls of the tube.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Pahoehoe – lava that often has a smooth surface or is ropey in form.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    AA – rough and jagged lava.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Blocky – large chunks of lava.\n  </li>\n</ul>",

Since time immemorial, the Osoyoos Indian Band’s Okanagan ancestors have inhabited and cared for the lands and waters in their traditional territory.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In 2015, the park was renamed to reflect the traditional Okanagan place name for the area.

The nqilxʷcən/nsyilxcən place name for Kettle Falls is sx̌ʷnitkʷ or “big falls.” These two falls were two of the most important fishing sites in the Okanagan Nation’s traditional territory.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The place name for sx̌ʷəx̌ʷnitkʷ contains unique sounds in the nqilxʷcən/nsyilxcen language that are difficult to translate into the English alphabet. The x̌ʷ is a vibrational sound. Think of the sound of water hitting the rocks at the falls. The i sounds similar to “ee.” The kʷ sound is made with a rounded mouth and sounds similar to a soft “coo” sound.\n</p>\n<h4>Special Notes</h4>\n<p>\n  Please note that sx̌ʷəx̌ʷnitkʷ park closes annually the third weekend of September for the Okanagan Nation Alliance’s Salmon Feast. The event raises awareness of Okanagan history and culture, as well as the Okanagan Nation’s efforts to revitalize and restore sockeye salmon numbers in the Okanagan River.

The park is located within the traditional territory of the Osoyoos Indian Band.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      sx̌ʷəx̌ʷnitkʷ park was part of an historic reserve allotment to the Osoyoos Indian Band. The reserve was set aside in 1877 for fishing purposes, but was cut-off in 1913 by the McKenna-McBride Royal Commission to meet settler demands for more land in the region.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      In the 1950s, the falls that gave sx̌ʷəx̌ʷnitkʷ park its name were blasted to make way for a flood control dam.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The present day park was established on March 16, 1956. In 2015, the Province and Osoyoos Indian Band agreed that the Osoyoos Indian Band will manage sx̌ʷəx̌ʷnitkʷ park.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong>\n      sx̌ʷəx̌ʷnitkʷ park has archaeological and cultural heritage significance to the Osoyoos Indian Band and the Okanagan People. There are several archaeological and cultural heritage sites and landforms within the surrounding area that tell an important story about how coyote brought salmon to the Okanagan People.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      For thousands of years, the Osoyoos Indian Band’s Okanagan ancestors used, occupied, lived, camped, traded and fished at sx̌ʷəx̌ʷnitkʷ. Historically, Chinook, Coho and Sockeye Salmon were fished in abundance at sx̌ʷəx̌ʷnitkʷ. Today, however, due to extirpated (Coho) and endangered (Chinook) salmon populations, sockeye are the only salmon species fished at sx̌ʷəx̌ʷnitkʷ.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The cultural heritage values in the park include opportunities for the ongoing continuance of Okanagan culture through traditional, ceremonial and cultural use of the area.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Please help respect and protect this historically and culturally important area by following the park rules and reporting any suspected archaeological or cultural heritage objects to park staff. Park guests are also reminded that Heritage Conservation Act protects all archaeological and cultural heritage sites in the province. This includes intact or disturbed, known or unknown, recorded or unrecorded sites.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Conservation:</strong>\n      This park conserves riparian vegetation that is important habitat for a variety of bird and bat species including the red listed Pallid bat.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Wildlife:</strong>\n      The park offers superb bird watching, with sightings of Western wood peewees, Yellow warblers, Northern orioles and Least flycatchers.

      "natureAndCulture": "<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>History:</strong>\n    Created in 1955, this park shows what effective park planning can achieve. In the late fifties, thousands of non-native trees were planted on a barren hillside between the highway and the lake. Today, this area is a natural arboretum and the extensive tree cover is home to various bird types.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Conservation:</strong>\n    Though the campground areas are dotted with irrigated lawn and non-native trees, the park still falls into two basic zones with bunchgrass found in exposed areas at low elevations and stands of Ponderosa pine and Douglas fir found in the upper sections. Many wildflowers can be seen along the nature trail away from the more developed areas of the park. Of special note are the Chocolate lily and the Columbian lily.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Wildlife:</strong>\n    The close proximity of the highway and the fencing on the uphill side prevent movement of large mammals such as deer into the campground. Though sightings of large mammals may be infrequent, the park still has a variety of wildlife to see. Harmless gopher snakes and colonies of Columbian ground squirrels can be seen along upland hiking trails. Bats are quite common in areas bordering lakes and may be seen from the park, though they generally prefer areas with less human presence. The Western toad and Western painted turtle have been spotted in the park which also provides habitat for a variety of birds such as Cedar waxwings, quail, Northern shafted flickers, Western meadowlarks, hummingbirds and a blue listed bird species, the Lewis’s woodpecker. Insect life is extremely diverse in the park with the Ant Lion being, perhaps, the most interesting. They live buried in conical shaped traps in the sand in ambush for other insects.\n  </li>\n</ul>",

There are archaeological sites and provincially significant First Nations pictographs found on rock outcrops and canyon walls. At one time, the local Salish Indigenous peoples used Wild Horse Canyon as a wild-horse trap.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Historic trails form part of the current trail network, some dating back to 1860, when Father Pandosy established an oblate mission near Kelowna. Settlers used a trail through Wild Horse Canyon, but finding the south end of the trail crossed extremely rough and rocky country, Father Pandosy instituted a better trail higher up to the east.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Good’s Creek Canyon Trail was named for Dave Good, supplier of survey crews for the Kettle Valley Railway, built in 1915. Commando Bay was used to secretly train Chinese-Canadians for guerrilla warfare in 1944, during World War II.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Little remains at the crash site of a DC3 passenger plane that went down in December of 1950 roughly one km northeast of Divide Lake. The two CP Air pilots died in the crash, while 16 others on board were rescued by local search and rescue teams. There is no trail access to the site.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Conservation:</strong>\n      The park is a representative example of the Okanagan Basin and Okanagan Highlands. The terrain ranges from the deeply incised melt water channels of Good Creek and Wildhorse Canyon to the 1579m high Okanagan Mountain with spectacular examples of heavily glaciated rock terrain including classic rock drumlins, grooves, flutes and striations.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The park encompasses ecosystems from three different biogeoclimatic zones: the bunchgrass zone in some of the lower but more exposed areas, the ponderosa pine zone in much of the lower elevations and the interior Douglas fir zone on the upper mountain reaches. Significant old growth Ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, Lodgepole pine and Engelmann spruce covers more than 2500 hectares. The park’s plant life represents the influence of both the dry southern and wetter northern climates. The park protects a significant portion of undeveloped lakeshore along Okanagan Lake.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Wildlife:</strong>\n      The variety of ecosystems represented in the park leads to an abundance of wildlife that is surprising in an area so close to Kelowna.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The rugged rocky terrain is habitat for mountain goats. White-tailed deer, moose, elk, lynx, marten, coyote are also found in the park. Small but very important species are the blue listed Western harvest mouse, Nuttall’s cottontail (the furthest northerly occurrence) and Spotted bat. The Northern alligator lizard and Western skink can be found under rocks or bark in open wooded areas while the Yellow-bellied racer prefers grasslands and open fields.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Blue listed reptile species found in the park include Western painted turtle, Rubber boa, Gopher snake, Western blue racer and Western rattlesnake.

The dam has now been completely removed resulting in lower water levels in the lake chain.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    This park is one of seven new parks and protected areas resulting from the Morice Land and Resource Management Plan (LRMP) and associated government-to-government discussions with the Office of the Wet’suwet’en.

The area also has abundant moose, and is known for wild rice (Fritillaria camschatcensis) and wild celery.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    The cultural heritage role for Old Man Lake Park is to provide a connection to place for the Wet’suwet’en Nation. Cultural heritage on the land is the essence of the Wet’suwet’en identity.\n    <br>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Conservation:</strong>\n    Old Man Lake Park protects rare wetland ecosystems that offer high value breeding and migratory bird habitat. Red listed Saskatoon Slender wheatgrass grasslands are also protected along with south facing grassland slopes that provide high quality ungulate winter range. Additionally, the park contains a high diversity of berry producing shrubs and food producing plants that are historically important to the Wet’suwet’en First Nation.\n    <br>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Wildlife:</strong>\n    Old Man Lake Park provides important habitat for wildlife that live in and around the park and contains important ungulate winter range. Lower snow depths are important for moose and deer. American Bitterns (blue-listed) have been heard in the Old Man Lake area and are suspected to be breeding in the park. Trumpeter Swans are known to breed in the park and a garter snake winter den has been noted in the park. The area is routinely used as a stopover by migratory birds and contains locally rare breeding populations of Black Tern and Yellow-headed Blackbird. Peregrine Falcons (red-listed) have been observed preying on waterfowl in the Old Man Lake/China Nose area. The cliffs on China Nose Mountain are an ideal nesting location for Peregrine Falcons with good access to prey in Old Man Lake Park. Old Man Lake is eutrophic, and vulnerable to winter kill due to its shallowness and extremely abundant growth of aquatic weeds. Suitable habitat for Rainbow Trout is present.\n  </li>\n</ul>",

It was formerly used by First Nations as a base camp for hunting and trapping. The fur trade attracted the Hudson’s Bay Company to the area and their fur brigades used a route which passed through the town. They named it “Encampment des Femmes” after the women who waited for their men out trapping or on the brigades.

Communities sprung up on the strength of the coal and copper mining industry and attracted the Kettle Valley Railway (KVR) and the Granby Mining Company. The region became Canada’s sole supplier of platinum and its coal powered the KVR and the VV&amp;E, part of the Great Northern Railway. Today, crumbling building foundations and the empty rail-bed of the KVR winding towards the horizon are echoes of a prosperous past.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n</ul>",

      "description": "<p>\n  Welcome to Paarens Beach Provincial Park. Situated on the south-west shore of beautiful Stuart Lake, Paarens Beach is a delightful small provincial park that few people outside of the area seem to know about. With an uncrowded campground, large beach and boat launch, it is an ideal base from which to explore the rich history and enjoy the multitude of recreational opportunities around Stuart Lake and the nearby community of Fort St. James.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If relaxing on the beach or around your campfire at Paarens Beach is not enough, there is plenty to see and do in the Fort St. James area.&nbsp;The Fort St James Visitor Info Centre can provide the visitor with maps, directions and information on things to do and see in and around the community.\n</p>\n<p>\n  There are close to twenty lodges and resorts on various lakes or rivers, canoeing opportunities on the Nation Lakes Chain (there is an Arctic grayling catch and release fishery here!), and houseboats available on Takla Lake.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If you want to avoid the crowds, the campground at Paarens Beach is extremely attractive. Each of the 39 campsites has a picnic table and fire ring. A number of campsites at Paarens Beach are available for reservation. To reserve a site, use the\n  <a href=\"https://camping.bcparks.ca/\">\n    BC Parks reservations system</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A large day-use/picnic area is located on a lengthy stretch of wide sandy beach. Change houses, abundant picnic tables, a playground for the kids and a log picnic shelter are all available to help you enjoy leisurely summer days swimming and sunbathing at the beach. A boat launch is also located within the park to access Stuart Lake.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Stuart Lake, one of the largest natural lakes in the province at about 70 kilometres long, is the southernmost in a chain of three lakes. The Stuart-Takla chain includes Stuart Lake, the Tachie River, Trembleur Lake, the Middle River, which has been designated a Provincial Heritage River, and finally the remote and spectacular Takla Lake. Takla is the fifth largest natural lake in the province at close to 90 kilometres in length.\n</p>",

Producing 3–5 million native rainbow trout eggs annually and roughly 40% of the provincial hatchery needs, the fishery is considered vital for the provincial fish culture program. The Pennask Lake fishery is particularly valuable since its large spawning runs peak around two or three weeks later than other runs, allowing flexibility in the hatching process to maximize hatchery outputs.

During the fall of 1945 construction on the highway began. In 1950 Mount Le Moray Lodge was built in the Pine Pass; the lodge mainly catered to the travelling public and to the construction crews building, maintaining and eventually paving Highway 97.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The improvements of this Highway greatly facilitated access into BC’s north country. Eventually, with increasing use, the pine pass area of the Highway became a popular destination for skiing, snowmobiling, fishing, hunting, and camping. To accommodate some of the visitors to the area, a Forest Recreation site was established at Hart Lake.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The popularity of the area for recreation and wildlife led to the area being designated for park and protected area status within the Dawson Creek LRMP in 2000 and the Mackenzie LRMP in 2001.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong>\n      Area of traditional use by First Nations of the Treaty 8 Tribal Association.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Conservation:</strong>\n      The park and protected area protects the upper watersheds of Link Creek, Mountain Creek and Pine River.

Pirates Cove Marine offers a sheltered anchorage for boaters, as well as two dinghy docks – one on either side of the cove.\n</p>\n<p>\n  This scenic marine park has a colourful natural and cultural history. Its settlement history ranges from extensive First Nations use to a homestead for the Aquarian Foundation, a religious cult led by Brother XII, who convinced 8,000 followers to give up their worldly possessions and follow him to De Courcy Island in the 1920s and early 1930s. Several middens in the park indicate First Nations use of the land dating back more than 3,000 years. The largest of these shell refuse heaps underlies the present campground. Today, this intertidal area is still abundant with a variety of shellfish and marine life.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Pirates Cove Marine offers a variety of excellent wildlife viewing opportunities. Common marine mammals include harbour seals (year-round) and Steller’s and California sea lions (common from late August through the mid-May). The fortunate may catch glimpses of harbour porpoises or orcas, as well as Gray and Humpback whales in the summer. River otters also frequent the park and are most easily seen in the early morning. A stroll around the Pylades Trail in the park will likely result in a sighting or two. Watch for areas of flattened grass that otters have used for slides or sun-bathing.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Birdwatchers will find Wilson’s warblers, Pacific-slope flycatchers, Black oystercatchers, White crowned sparrows and other species breeding in the park.

The search for gold began in 1861, and by 1878 most of the Stikine River drainage had been explored. From 1896 to 1902, Andrew J. Stone conducted expeditions into the Cassiar to collect specimens for the American Museum of Natural History. With his announcements of the discovery of several “new” species of sheep and caribou, the area became a destination for hunters. Local natives worked as hunting guides and camps were set up throughout the region. Scientists began studying the significant wildlife values in the area in the 1950s and with the efforts of Tommy Walker, Spatsizi Plateau Wilderness Park was designated in 1975.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    Pitman River Protected Area was designated by the Provincial Government in 2001 following recommendations on the Cassiar Iskut-Stikine Land and Resource Management Plan.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong>\n    Pitman River lies within the asserted traditional territories of the Tahltan First Nations, Kaska Dena Council and Carrier Sekani Tribal Council. Although archaeological studies have not been done in the park, it is likely to contain archaeological sites because high wildlife values would have attracted native and non-native usage.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Conservation:</strong>\n    Pitman River Protected Area is within the Cassiar Ranges Ecosection and the Southern Boreal Plateau Ecosection.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Wildlife:</strong>\n    Pitman River contributes to a network of parks in the Stikine area which provide habitat to a wide range of animals. Three blue-listed species whose habitat is protected in the protected area are the wolverine, the fisher and the grizzly bear. The whole protected area is considered high value habitat for caribou, while significant wetland moose habitat is found along the river, which also provides good quality grizzly habitat. Mountain goats and Stone’s sheep are found in the upper elevations. Other species found in the park include wolf, black bear, lynx, coyote, red fox, marten and minx.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    The Stikine, Chuckachida and Pitman River Parks represent the only fully protected area in B.C. enclosing contiguous streams, large rivers and lakes believed to support bull trout in the full diversity of its life histories. Other fish species found in the Protected Area waters include Dolly varden and char, while rainbow trout and arctic grayling are likely to be found but have not been confirmed.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    Pitman River Protected Area is a key wildlife corridor, providing connectivity to high value habitat in adjacent areas.\n  </li>\n</ul>",

      "natureAndCulture": "<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>History:</strong>\n    Rathtrevor takes its name from the Irish family who homesteaded on this land. William Rath, a gold prospector, arrived in 1886 with his young wife and baby daughter. They built a log cabin, cleared the land, and in 1895 they built the barn. William died in 1903, leaving Elizabeth the farm and five children. She proved to be an industrious person, successfully running the farm and eventually operating it as a campground. The suffix “trevor” was added to give the campground a more lyrical name. Rathtrevor Campground became Rathtrevor Beach Provincial Park in 1967 and though much has changed since William and Elizabeth first arrived, its beauty and importance will be preserved for our continued enjoyment.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Wildlife:</strong>\n    Several species of wildlife can be seen in the park, including deer, raccoons, squirrels, otters, mink, eagles, osprey, hawks, vultures, owls, and many shore and migratory birds that use the park area during their spring and fall migrations. The most famous migratory shore birds are the Brant geese (\n    <em>\n      Branta bernicla\n    </em>\n    ) who use the beaches of Rathtrevor and Craig Bay as staging and feeding areas during their spring migration to northern Canada and Alaska.\n  </li>\n</ul>",

Since then the area has been the stage for a great deal of activity. In the early 1900s the lake was used as a holding pond for shingle bolts (short logs). A wooden flume sped the bolts 5 km downhill to the Stoltze mill at nearby Ruskin. In the early 1930s, the park area supported a small Japanese-Canadian hand logging operation typical of many that existed throughout the province.

Typical vegetation in the area includes Douglas-fir, western hemlock, western redcedar, and Pacific silver fir.

On September 14, 1939 he became a private in the Canadian Scottish Regiment at Comox, where, after extensive training, he rose to the rank of Lieutenant.

A mixture of forest, field and shore habitats makes it one of the most productive wildlife viewing areas on Salt Spring Island.

Irish emigrant Henry Ruckle first homesteaded here in 1872, marrying Ella Anna Christensen in 1877. Their descendants have farmed the Salt Spring property for more than a century.

A management agreement was signed in 1998 between the two parties and stablished a Park Management Board that oversees any issues related to the management, conservation, recreational and cultural heritage objectives for the area.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em>\n    Say Nuth Khaw Yum\n  </em>\n  means “Serpent’s Land.” It is in the core of Tsleil-Waututh traditional territory that has from time out of mind been an area of significance to the Tsleil-Waututh people.&nbsp; For over a millenium, the Tsleil-Waututh Nation has continued to use the land, water and resources of the entire area of Indian Arm.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Say Nuth Khaw Yum Provincial Park [aka Indian Arm Park] is a conservation park that protects the shores of Indian Arm, an 18 kilometre fjord that extends north from Burrard Inlet in Vancouver. The park area was once heavily glaciated, leaving behind a spectacular landscape featuring rugged, forested mountains, several alpine lakes, and numerous creeks and waterfalls, including the 50-metre high Granite Falls. The park also includes Racoon and Twin Islands, both characterized by sparse vegetation, open cover, and exposed rocky ledges.The park offers a variety of recreation activities.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Indian Arm is ideal for motor boating, kayaking, canoeing, and scuba diving. Indian River and the lower reaches of some creeks are perfect for recreational fishing. The old-growth forested mountains provide opportunities for hiking, wildlife viewing and nature appreciation, while the flat beach areas along the shorelines of Bishop Creek provide opportunities for rustic camping, picnicking and other day-use activities. Marine access camping is also available on the south side of Granite Falls. The shoals around Racoon and Twin Islands offer good scuba diving. Visitors can also enjoy limited, rustic camping on North / Big Twin Island. Please note that there is no camping on South/Little Twin Island.\n</p>\n<h4>\n  Special Features\n</h4>\n<p>\n  There are two waterfalls within the park – Granite Falls and Silver Falls. The Indian River estuary protects important wildlife habitat. There is also a tidal lagoon between North and South Twin Islands. Black bear sightings are common along the shoreline. A large run of pink salmon (60,000 fish) make their way up the arm on odd numbered years. They can be seen jumping all along the shoreline. The fish concentrate in the Indian River estuary and then work their way up the Indian River. The Chum Salmon make their way up the arm annually in large numbers. Smaller numbers of Coho and Chinook salmon find their way back to the Indian River each year. With the concentration of salmon in the fall, large numbers of eagle can be viewed overhead, and amongst the salmon there are many seals feeding.\n</p>\n<p>\n  This park also contains a number of significant archaeological sites. All archaeological sites are protected under the Heritage Conservation Act.&nbsp; It is illegal to remove artifacts or to disturb such sites.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Date Established:</strong>\n  July 13, 1995\n  <br>\n  <strong>\n    Size:</strong>\n  6,689 hectares\n</p>",

In the 1930’s, the area was used as a relief camp for the workers building Highway 99. In 1976 the area was purchased by Carling O’Keefe Brewery, who used the pure mountain water to brew their beer, and made the area a logging show park. In 1982 O’Keefe donated the land to BC Parks. Throughout the park area there is evidence of logging activity that occurred here roughly 90 years ago. A number of excellent spring board notches on old stumps are scattered throughout the forested area and much of the deadfall also exhibits evidence of the logging techniques of this period.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Culture:</strong>\n    This park holds significant spiritual value to the Squamish First Nation, the first people to live in this area. They told of a two headed sea serpent, Say-noth-ka who lived in and around Howe Sound. According to legend this beast travelled both on land and in water. Some versions say it was Say-noth-ka who formed Shannon Falls by slithering and twisting his powerful body up the mountainside on repeated expeditions, Say-noth-ka gradually wore down a spillway for those cascading waters.\n  </li>\n</ul>",

The lush green lawns of Skihist have always invited travellers to stop and relax from the heat of the summer. The park preserves a section of the historic Cariboo Wagon road. The starting point of the road was in Yale and construction of the road took place between 1862 and 1865. The road was a narrow, treacherous track winding along the cliffs of the canyon and allowed stagecoaches and freight wagons access to the BC interior. The road linked the gold fields of the Cariboo to Vancouver.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Conservation:</strong>\n    BC Parks uses prescribed burns as a conservation tool. The intense build-up of Ponderosa pine needles on the forest floor in Skihist park could contribute to a catastrophic fire, should one occur. The needles also change the PH balance of the soil, restricting growth of grasses and plants. Prescribed burns are used in the campground to eliminate the needle build-up and provide opportunities for new growth.\n    <p>\n      Which plants can you identify?

The park was originally included as part of the Sechelt Provincial forest in 1934 and remained provincial forest until the 1950’s when the Department of Recreation and Conservation studied the recreational and tourism potential of the site. As a result, the outstanding scenic and interesting features of the rapids (covering 40.5 ha) were removed from the provincial forest and established as a Class A park. Over the years, more area has been added to the park, to bring it to its current size of 123 hectares.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Conservation:</strong>\n    This park protects south coast inlet shoreline, small islets, a small lake, maturing second growth hemlock and the phenomenal rapids.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Wildlife:</strong>\n    Birds, ground squirrels, chipmunks, raccoons, sea stars, urchin, anemone, chiton, flounder, red snapper, ling and rock cod, salmon species, crab, oysters, clams and mussels can all be found in the park.\n    <br>\n    An abundance of marine life is found in the ocean area around the park.

      "natureAndCulture": "<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>History:</strong>\n    The park was established on December 3, 1975. Named for the region of the province that it occupies, Spatsizi means “red goat” in the Tahltan First Nation language. It was a name given to the mountain goats of the area because of their habit of rolling in the iron oxide-coloured dust, which changed their normally white coats to red.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    Historically, Spatsizi Plateau and area was the hunting ground of the Tahltan First Nation. It was seldom visited by outsiders prior to 1926, when the Hyland brothers established a post on the Spatsizi River to trade with native fur trappers. In 1948, Tommy Walker set up permanent hunting and fishing camps at Hyland Post and Cold Fish Lake, hiring local Indigenous people from Caribou Hide as guides. It was largely due to the efforts of Walker that the park and Gladys Lake Ecological Reserve were created in 1975.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong>Since time immemorial the area has been heavily used by the local Tahltan indigenous people and their ancestors. The area is still culturally significant for the Tahltan Nation today. Archaeological finds (including obsidian, tools, and other artifacts) are to be left in place and reported to the local BC Parks or Tahltan Central Government office.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Conservation:</strong>\n    This park spreads across two broad physiographic regions, the Spatsizi Plateau and the Skeena Mountains. The plateau, a rolling upland, ranges in elevation from 1,600 to 2,000 metres, and extends in a broad curve broken by wide “u” shaped valleys. The Eaglenest Range of the Skeena Mountains&nbsp;dominates the northwest. Its highest peak, Mt. Will (2,500 metres) towers above Gladys Lake.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    A portion of the central part of the park just south of Cold Fish Lake has been designated as the Gladys Lake Ecological Reserve. The reserve was created for the study of stone sheep and mountain goats in an undisturbed habitat. Persons wishing to view these animals may hike the reserve.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Wildlife:</strong>\n    Lands within the park have an excellent capability for supporting large populations of wildlife. The light snow depths in the rain shadow of the Eaglenest Range create one of the most important habitats for woodland caribou in British Columbia. The Spatsizi River Valley, with its many flooded areas and oxbow ponds, provides aquatic vegetation for summer forage as well as willow flats for winter browse for moose. Grizzly and black bears, wolverines, beaver, hoary marmot, and Arctic ground squirrels are abundant and more than 140 species of birds including gyrfalcons, Smith’s longspurs and American Golden Plovers have been recorded within the park boundaries.\n  </li>\n</ul>",

The search for gold began in 1861, and by 1878 most of the Stikine River drainage had been explored. From 1896 to 1902, Andrew J. Stone conducted expeditions into the Cassiar to collect specimens for the American Museum of Natural History. With his announcements of the discovery of several “new” species of sheep and caribou, the area became a destination for hunters. Local natives worked as hunting guides and camps were set up throughout the region. Scientists began studying the significant wildlife values in the area in the 1950s and with the efforts of Tommy Walker, Spatsizi Plateau Wilderness Park was designated in 1975.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    The BCR railgrade that passes within 3km of the park was extended in the 1970’s to promote trade and resource development in the Cassiar region. The railway was not completed but the grade and a bridge across the Stikine were constructed and are used today by hikers, hunters and horseback riders.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    Spatsizi Headwaters Park was designated by the Provincial Government in 2001 following recommendations on the Cassiar Iskut-Stikine Land and Resource Management Plan.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong>\n    Spatsizi Headwaters Park lies within the asserted traditional territories of the Tahltan First Nations and Carrier Sekani Tribal Council.

      "natureAndCulture": "<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>History:</strong>\n    The park was established on November 22, 1995, following a 25 year debate over development versus protection. The name comes from the Nlaka’pamux word “Stagyn,” which means “hidden place,” referring to the fact that the valley and the extent of the watershed is not very noticeable from the Stein River’s mouth on the Fraser River. The valley has been extremely important to the Nlaka’pamux people for thousands of years, both spiritually and for sustenance. Since the establishment of the park the Stein is managed via the Stein Valley Co-Operative Management Agreement between the Lytton First Nation and the Province of BC – on the Stein Management Board. The function of the Management Board is to oversee and provide management direction for all initiatives and undertakings related to the planning, operation and management of the Park. This arrangement also provides the park with two seasonal full-time Wardens who assist both the users of the park as well as maintaining values within the park particularly in the lower Stein. Please ensure all your activities within the park are respectful and you practice a “leave no trace” philosophy.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Conservation:</strong>\n    The Stein Valley straddles the transition from the dry interior to the wetter Coastal Mountains. This, combined with the large elevational gradient, has resulted in very diverse vegetation communities within the park. Dry ponderosa pine forests characterize the lower valley, while Douglas fir is predominant in the mid-valley and hemlock, cedar, spruce and fir become predominant in the western end of the valley. Patches of cedar exist throughout the valley, even at the eastern end in moist, cool locations along creeks such as Stryen and Teaspoon. Floodplain forests along the river are dominated by black cottonwood mixed with aspen and birch. Higher elevations are noted for stands of Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir, and above those are white bark pine and alpine tundra. Spectacular flower blooms occur in the spring and summer, particularly at higher elevations.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Wildlife:</strong>\n    Due to its size and relative lack of disturbance, the park contains populations of many species of wildlife that indicate its relative health as wilderness. It is thought to contain over 50 species of mammals, including mountain goat, cougar, wolverine, black bear and grizzly bear. Bird species include golden eagles, sharp shinned hawks, barred owls, pigmy owls, white-tailed ptarmigan, pileated woodpeckers and rufous hummingbirds, as well as several species of chickadees, warblers and nuthatches. The Stein River contains dolly varden char, rainbow trout and Rocky Mountain whitefish, as well as steelhead trout, coho, pink and chinook salmon that return to the river at certain times of the year to spawn.\n  </li>\n</ul>",

Today, the Tahltan live in the communities of Telegraph Creek, Dease Lake and Iskut. Seasonal locations are still utilized by members of the first nation for traditional resource harvest.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    In the mid 1860’s, the need for communications link to Europe initiated a survey of the Stikine for development of the Collins Overland Telegraph Trail.

This telegraph route was abandoned after cable was successfully laid across the Atlantic, linking North America with Europe.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong>\n    Since time immemorial the area has been heavily used by the local Tahltan indigenous people and their ancestors.

      "description": "<p>\n  Strathcona Provincial Park, designated in 1911, is the oldest provincial park in British Columbia. Located almost in the centre of Vancouver Island, Strathcona park is a rugged mountain wilderness comprising more than 250,000 hectares. Mountain peaks – some perpetually mantled with snow – dominate the park. Lakes and alpine tarns dot a landscape laced with rivers, creeks and streams. Summer in Strathcona is usually pleasantly warm, while winters are fairly mild except for the higher levels, where heavy snowfalls are the norm. From November through March, snowfalls can be expected on the mountain slopes and alpine plateaus. Snow remains all year on the mountain peaks and may linger into July even at moderate elevations. Summer evenings, as elsewhere in the coastal regions of B.C., can be cool and rain can be expected at any time of the year.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Two areas – Buttle Lake and vicinity, and Forbidden Plateau – offer a variety of visitor-oriented developments. The rest of the park is largely undeveloped and appeals primarily to people seeking wilderness surroundings. To see and enjoy much of the scenic splendor requires hiking or backpacking into the alpine regions.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Buttle Lake, named for Commander John Buttle who explored the area in the 1860s, is the major body of water in the park. It and many other lakes and waterways in the park can provide good fishing in season for Cutthroat, Rainbow and Dolly Varden trout. Della Falls, whose drop of 440 metres over three cascades makes it one of the highest waterfalls in Canada, is located in the southern remote section of the park with the trailhead only accessible by boat at the northwest end of Great Central Lake. And the highest point on Vancouver Island, the Golden Hinde (elevation 2,200 metres), stands almost in the centre of Strathcona to the west of Buttle Lake.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Three roadless tracts within Strathcon Provincial Park – Big Den, Central Strathcona and Comox Glacier--have been designated as nature conservancy areas. Each tract contains outstanding examples of scenery and natural history that remain uninfluenced by human activity. The three areas, totalling 122,500 hectares, are dedicated to the preservation of the undisturbed natural environment.\n</p>\n<p>\n  While the high mountain peaks and deep shaded valleys of Strathcona Park are dramatic, it is easy to forget that beneath your feet lays a history stretching back 380 million years. It is a history of violent volcanic eruptions on ancient seafloors and quiet interludes when gardens of sea lilies waved in gentle ocean currents. It is a history of rocks torn and folded by the extraordinary forces that can move continents, and of mountain ranges sculpted by the immensely thick ice sheets, which only vanished a few thousand years ago. No matter how long your visit, or whatever your interest, a knowledge of the\n  <a href=\"http://www.empr.gov.bc.ca/MINING/GEOSCIENCE/PUBLICATIONSCATALOGUE/INFORMATIONCIRCULARS/IC1995-07/Pages/GeologicalHistory.aspx\">\n    geology of Strathcona Park</a>\n  will enhance your enjoyment of this spectacularly beautiful area.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Strathcona Park benefits from excellent adjoining commercial facilities such as the Strathcona Park Lodge and Outdoor Education Centre, which offers outdoor education and wilderness skills training. The nearby communities of Campbell River, the Comox Valley, Gold River, Tofino and Port Alberni offer a full range of visitor services. Mount Washington Alpine Resort, located adjacent to the park, offers extensive alpine and nordic skiing opportunities, as well as a variety of winter and summer recreation facilities.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The\n  <a href=\"/explore/parkpgs/strath_mt/\" class=\"legacy-link\">\n    Megin-Talbot addition</a>\n  in Strathcona Provincial Park was identified for protection in the Clayoquot Sound Land-Use Decision in 1995.\n</p>",

      "natureAndCulture": "<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      <strong>History:</strong>\n      Strathcona Park, designated in 1911, is the oldest provincial park in British Columbia. In the valleys and lower regions of Strathcona are forest stands that were already old when Captain James Cook of Britain’s Royal Navy landed at Nootka Sound in 1778, on the west coast of Vancouver Island a few kilometres from what is now the western boundary of the park.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Strathcona Park was named for Donald Alexander Smith, First Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal, a Canadian pioneer and one of the principals in the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway. On November 7, 1885 Lord Strathcona drove the last iron spike into the twin ribbons of steel that united Canada from the Atlantic to the Pacific at Craigellachie in BC’s Selkirk Mountains.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Conservation:</strong>\n      Western red cedar, Douglas fir, grand fir, amabilis fir and western hemlock cover much of the park’s valleys and lower mountain slopes; this gives way to sub-alpine fir, mountain hemlock and creeping juniper in the sub-alpine areas. Throughout the summer months the park offers a spectacular floral display in various areas from sea level to above 1,800 metres elevation. Found at varying heights are varieties of heather, lupine, monkey flowers and violets as well as Indian paintbrush, phlox and moss campion.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Wildlife:</strong>\n      Vancouver Island’s separation from mainland British Columbia by Johnstone and Georgia Straits means that many mammal species common to other parts of the province are not found on the Island. Species such as the Roosevelt elk, the currently-endangered Vancouver Island marmot, the Vancouver Island wolf, and the coastal black-tailed deer are different from their mainland relatives. The park has a large deer population and a significant number of Roosevelt elk while wolves and cougars, though present, are seldom seen. Resident birds include the chestnut-backed chickadee, red-breasted nuthatch, winter wren and kinglet, as well as the gray jay, Steller’s jay and band-tailed pigeon. The park also supports numerous blue grouse, ruffled grouse and a limited number of unique Vancouver Island white-tailed ptarmigan.\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"docs/strathcona-marmots.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"legacy-link\">\n          Poster: Reintroducing Vancouver Island Marmots to Strathcona Provincial Park [PDF]\n        </a>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>",

      "description": "<p>\n  The Stuart-Trembleur-Takla Lake boating system is located in north central British Columbia and comprises nearly 300 km of waterway. These long, narrow lakes are among the region’s most significant recreational features. The lakes offer great sports fishing opportunities for rainbow and lake trout, burbot, kokanee, and mountain whitefish. The chain is also part of the longest migration route of chinook and sockeye salmon in British Columbia. With more than 630 km of lakeshore to explore, few developed facilities, and sparse levels of use, this chain of lakes provides a remote wilderness experience. A series of small parks have been established along the system providing protected anchorages or attractive beaches. No facilities have been developed at these sites.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Stuart Lake is one of the largest natural lakes in the province at 90 km long with 270 km of shoreline. The community of Fort St. James is located on the southeast end. The main body of the lake is between 6 to 10 km wide and is road accessible at many locations. The northwestern arm of the lake is narrower, has limited road access, and more of a wilderness feel. This portion of the lake is very scenic with numerous bays, points, and islands. Wildlife viewing, boating, hunting, and angling are popular pursuits in the area.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Stuart Lake Marine Park consists of three lakeside sites protected as part of the Stuart-Trembleur-Takla Lakes boating system. Stuart Lake Park is also on the Stuart-Trembleur-Takla Lakes boating system. These sites provide no facilities, but may offer protected anchorages or sandy beaches.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The Tachie River connects Stuart Lake to Trembleur Lake. The 26 km of river can be a challenge to navigate with fast water and small rapids. Trembleur Lake is almost 50 km long. It has an irregular shoreline with sheltered bays and coves and a scenic wilderness setting. There is one marine park site on Trembleur Lake.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The Middle River flows from Takla Lake into Trembleur Lake. The river, designated as a Provincial Heritage River, is 22 km long and navigable. At 96 km in length, Takla is the fifth largest lake in the province. Almost 250 km of undisturbed shoreline with sandy beaches and isolated bays are available to explore. There are three marine park sites on Takla Lake. There is sporadic road access on the east side of the lake.\n</p>\n<h4>\n  NTS map references:\n</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Stuart Lake – 93K/7, 93K/8, 93K/9, 93K/10, 93K/11\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Tachie River – 93K/10 &amp; 93K/15\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Trembleur Lake – 93K14 &amp; 93K/15\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Middle River – 93K/14\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Takla Lake – 93M/1, 93M/8, 93M/9, 93N/3, 93N/4, 93N/5\n  </li>\n</ul>",

In 1806, Simon Fraser brought the fur trade to this area with the establishment of the Stuart Lake Post for the North West Company.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The company merged with the Hudson’s Bay Company in 1821, and in 1822 they named the settlement Fort St. James. Fort St. James, once the economic capital of the colony of New Caledonia, saw its importance as a fur trading centre diminish in 1869 when gold was discovered 100 miles north in the Omineca Valley.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      With the miners came a new economic prosperity for the area that has largely been replaced by the forest industry today. Tourism is also growing, and hunting and fishing lodges can be found on all three lakes.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong>\n    <p>\n      Although settled by Europeans almost 200 years ago, the Dakelh-ne people had inhabited the area for years prior. To the fur traders, these people became known as the Carrier people, referring to the custom of widows who carried the ashes of cremated husbands with them until a traditional potlatch could be held.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The Carrier people traditionally led a semi-nomadic life, congregating along lakes and rivers in the warmer months to pick berries, hunt and tan hides, and catch and process the salmon that was an important staple of their diet. The winter was spent ice fishing and trapping in smaller family units.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Several Carrier groups reside in the Stuart-Trembleur-Takla lakes area including the Nak’azdli, Yekoochet’en, Takla, and Tl’azt’en. Traditional trails, culturally altered trees, and pictographs can be found throughout the area.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Conservation:</strong>\n    <p>\n      The three small sites of Stuart Lake Marine Park and Stuart Lake Park protect natural areas and contribute to the role of the Stuart-Trembleur-Takla lakes system as a backcountry boating destination area.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Wildlife:</strong>\n    <p>\n      Diversity of the terrain and types of vegetation support abundant wildlife populations. Moose and black bear are plentiful. Other more secretive species include mule and white-tail deer, wolf, and grizzly bear. Furbearers in the area include lynx, fox, beaver, marten, fisher, otter, and wolverine.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n</ul>",

However, black bears do frequent the area. Muskrat and beaver can be seen around the lakeshore and the Tupper River which drains into the lake through the park.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      If you are interested in bird watching, an abundance of waterfowl and migratory bird populations congregate at Swan Lake. An example of birds that frequent Swan Lake include common loon, red-necked grebe, western grebe, trumpeter swan, American widgeon, sandpipers, bufflehead, coot, gulls, eastern kingbird, warblers, blackbirds, killdeer, hooded merganser, red-eyed and warbling vireo, hermit thrush, swallows, yellowlegs, scoters, lesser scaup and goldeneyes, just to name a few.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Swan Lake is popular with local anglers. Sport fish include walleye, northern pike, yellow perch and burbot. Northern pike spawn in the spring among lakeshore weeds. Yellow perch, which have been stocked, are also weed spawners, but spawn later in spring. The lake is too shallow and too warm to support cold water salmonid species such as trout and char.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n</ul>",

The Tahsish River estuary contains a heritage site situated in Kyuquot Indian Reserve No. 11. This site was a historic First Nations village inhabited during the salmon season. There are no standing structures, but archaeological deposits are expected to be present.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    Historic documents and native legend refer to a major trade route known as the Grease Trail between Tahsish Inlet and the mouth of Nimpkish River via the Tahsish River valley, Atluck Lake and Nimpkish Lake. It is also apparent from the establishment of Kyuquot Indian Reserve No. 11 that the Tahsish River area was a traditional hunting and fishing area.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Conservation:</strong>\n    Tahsish-Kwois Provincial Park and the adjacent Ecological Reserve area are situated at the head of Kyuquot Sound where the Tahsish River flows into Tahsish Inlet. This park is one of the largest parks on Vancouver Island, covering approximately 11,022 hectares. The park’s natural features include old growth clad 1,200 metre high mountains, a high-elevation lake (850 metres), a significant low-elevation lake (100 metres), a scenic river canyon and U-shaped river valleys. The adjacent Ecological Reserve encompasses 70 hectares of an island tidal estuary containing tidal meadows, a rare plant species, Roosevelt elk and black bear habitat.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    Tahsish-Kwois Provincial Park has three rivers which provide fish rearing habitat for provincially significant populations of salmonid species. Only one river, the Tahsish, is not wholly contained within the park, but has its source and half its length beyond the park’s eastern boundary.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    The Tahsish-Kwois system supports all anadromous and resident salmonid species native to Vancouver Island. In the estuary of the Tahsish River, the network of channels with various depths, flow characteristics and substrates present provides migrating, spawning and particularly rearing habitat for salmonid fish. The Tahsish watershed supports populations of at least 10 species of fish.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Wildlife:</strong>\n    The watersheds that comprise Tahsish-Kwois Provincial Park are a natural ecosystem supporting viable populations of most wildlife species occurring on Vancouver Island. All the major predator and fur-bearing species inhabit the area, including grey wolves, cougar, black bears, Roosevelt elk, black-tailed deer, mink, raccoon and river otter. The park also supports a variety of birds associated with the aquatic and old growth forest habitat.

      "description": "The Stuart-Trembleur-Takla Lake boating system is located in north central British Columbia and comprises nearly 300 km of waterway. These long, narrow lakes are among the region’s most significant recreational features.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe lakes offer great sports fishing opportunities for rainbow and lake trout, burbot, kokanee, and mountain whitefish. The chain is also part of the longest migration route of chinook and sockeye salmon in British Columbia. With more than 630 km of lakeshore to explore, few developed facilities, and sparse levels of use, this chain of lakes provides a remote wilderness experience. A series of small parks have been established along the system providing protected anchorages or attractive beaches. No facilities have been developed at these sites.\n<br>\n<br>\nStuart Lake, one of the largest lakes in the province at 90 km long, is the southernmost lake of the chain. The community of Fort St. James is located on the southeast end of the lake. The main body of the lake is between 6 to 10 km wide and is road accessible at many locations. The northwest arm of the lake is narrower, has limited road access, and more of a wilderness feel. This portion of the lake is very scenic with numerous bays, points, and islands. There are four marine park sites on Stuart Lake and two provincial campgrounds.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe Tachie River connects Stuart Lake to Trembleur Lake. The 26 km of river can be a challenge to navigate with fast water and small rapids. Trembleur Lake is almost 50 km long. It has an irregular shoreline with sheltered bays and coves, and a scenic wilderness setting. There is one marine park site on Trembleur Lake.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe Middle River flows from Takla Lake into Trembleur Lake. The river, designated as a Provincial Heritage River, is 22 km long and navigable. At 96 km in length, Takla is the fifth largest lake in the province. Almost 250 km of undisturbed shoreline with sandy beaches and isolated bays are available to explore. There are three marine park sites on Takla Lake. There is sporadic road access on the east side of the lake.\n<br>\n<br>\nLimited facilities are available at the village of Takla Landing which is located 40 km north of Takla Narrows.\n<br>\n<br>\nTakla Lake Marine Provincial Park consists of three sites on Takla Lake protected as part of the Stuart-Trembleur-Takla Lakes boating system. These sites provide no facilities but may offer protected anchorages or sandy beaches.\n<br>\n<br>\nFrom the mouth of the Middle River at the south end, the ‘Y’ shaped lake is nearly 100 km in length, making it one of the largest lakes in the province. The Northwest Arm is 40 km long; the maximum depth of Takla Lake is 287 metres. Almost 250 km of undisturbed shoreline with sandy beaches and isolated bays are available to explore. Wildlife viewing, boating, hunting, and angling are popular pursuits in the area.

      "natureAndCulture": "<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>History:</strong>\n    For many years prior to the arrival of European explorers, the Stuart-Trembleur-Takla lakes area was home to the Dakelh-ne people. In 1806 Simon Fraser brought the fur trade to the area with the establishment of the Stuart Lake Post for the North West Company.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    The company merged with the Hudson’s Bay Company in 1821, and in 1822 they named the settlement Fort St. James. Fort St. James, once the economic capital of the colony of New Caledonia and said to be the oldest European-settled community in British Columbia, saw its importance as a fur trading centre diminish in 1869 when gold was discovered 100 miles north in the Omineca Valley. With the miners came a new economic prosperity for the area that has largely been replaced by the forest industry today. Tourism is also growing, and hunting and fishing lodges can be found on all three lakes.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong>\n    Although settled by Europeans almost 200 years ago, the Dakelh-ne people had inhabited the area for years prior. To the fur traders, these people became known as the Carrier people, referring to the custom of widows who carried the ashes of cremated husbands with them until a traditional potlach could be held.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    The Carrier people traditionally led a semi-nomadic life, congregating along lakes and rivers in the warmer months to pick berries, hunt and tan hides, and catch and process the salmon that was an important staple of their diet. The winter was spent ice fishing and trapping in smaller family units.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    Several Carrier groups reside in the Stuart-Trembleur-Takla lakes area including the Nak’azdli, Yekoochet’en, Takla, and Tl’azt’en. Traditional trails, culturally altered trees, and pictographs can be found throughout the area.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Conservation:</strong>\n    The three small sites of Takla Lake Marine Park protect natural areas and contribute to the role of the Stuart – Trembleur – Takla lakes system as a backcountry boating destination area.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Wildlife:</strong>\n    Diversity of the terrain and types of vegetation support abundant wildlife populations. Moose and black bear are plentiful. Other less visible species include mule and white-tail deer, wolf, and grizzly bear. Furbearers in the area include the lynx, fox, beaver, marten, fisher, otter, and wolverine.\n  </li>\n</ul>",

McConnell in 1913. Many of the park place names were taken from the names of early surveyors and explorers.

      "description": "<p>\n  Tatshenshini-Alsek is considered to be one of the most magnificent river systems on earth, and forms the basis of the park that bears its name. Tatshenshini-Alsek Park contains nearly one million hectares of glacier-cloaked peaks, wild rivers, grizzly bears and unusual plant communities. Situated in the very northwest corner of British Columbia, it nestles between Kluane National Park and Reserves in the Yukon and Glacier Bay &amp; Wrangell-St. Elias National Parks and Preserves in Alaska. Combined, these parks comprise the largest protected area in the world, approximately 8.5 million hectares. The Tatshenshini-Alsek Park has been designated as a\n  <a href=\"http://whc.unesco.org/sites/72.htm\">\n    World Heritage Site</a>\n  by UNESCO. The Alsek and Tatshenshini rivers are responsible for much of what’s special in the area. The great gap they’ve carved through the coastal mountains allows cool, moist ocean air into the cold interior. The quick change from ocean to interior environment, frequent floods, landslides and avalanches, a varied geology and great elevation changes have together created an exceptionally diverse range of habitat conditions.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Despite its remote location the ruggedly beautiful Tatshenshini-Alsek region is attracting an increasing number of recreationalists:\n  <a href=\"rafting-kayaking\" class=\"legacy-link\">\n    kayakers and rafters</a>\n  are drawn to the two magnificent river systems;\n  <a href=\"hiking-biking\" class=\"legacy-link\">\n    hikers</a>\n  and mountaineers confront a near-endless pristine wilderness that includes everything from alpine meadows to the jagged edges of the Alsek Ranges and Mt. Fairweather, the province’s highest peak at 4,633 metres; and\n  <a href=\"hiking-biking\" class=\"legacy-link\">\n    mountain bikers</a>\n  can explore old mining roads and other interesting and challenging terrain. Interestingly, the Haines Highway provides an opportunity to see much of the same unusual plant and animal diversity that river users experience.</p>",

If planning to hike or mountain bike, it is important to remember that weather conditions in the summer are highly variable. Although a day may start with clear skies and sunshine, it can quickly change, and snow is possible any day of the year. High winds are frequent and there are often long spells of cold, wet weather.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Rafters must be aware that the remoteness of this park is an\n    <strong>essential</strong>\n    factor to consider in trip preparation and safety.

The hot springs are situated on the left bank of the Toad River about 1 km upstream of its confluence with the Racing River. Access is via river boat or horseback. Currently, use is limited by access but there is some regular recreational use.",

      "natureAndCulture": "<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>History:</strong>\n    The Fort Nelson Indian Band and Kaska Dena First Nations traditionally use the area. With the European demand for fur, trappers moved into the area during the early 1800’s. Since that time the popularity of the area has increased with hunting, fishing, and recreational boating avidly pursued. The significance of the hot springs first prompted the area to be set aside as a recreation reserve. The hot springs were then proposed as an ecological reserve in 1974. Site surveys were undertaken by B.C. Hydro in the early 1980s as part of the Liard River investigations. The Fort Nelson Land and Resource Management Plan recommended the area in 1997 as a Protected Area due to the regionally significant hot springs for wildlife, viewing, hiking and First Nations values. In 1999, the area was subsequently designated as a provincial park.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong>\n    Fort Nelson Indian Band and Kaska Dena traditional use area.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Conservation:</strong>\n    The park occurs within the Muskwa Foothills ecosection of the Toad River valley. The valley has a large active floodplain extensively disturbed by fire that resulted in a diverse vegetation mosaic and important wildlife habitat. A series of hot springs with diverse, thermal-influenced plant communities originate at the base of alluvial terraces on the Toad River. The three main hot springs originate in the middle of an extensive muddy area. The lower river bars around the springs are covered by shrubby vegetation such as glaucous-leaved honeysuckle, common snowberry, western choke cherry and silverberry. The higher terrace hosts alluvial poplar forests with luxurious herb layers that are mainly the result of nutrient enrichment caused by animals visiting the mineral lick. These hot springs are an important mineral lick used by moose and other ungulates.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Wildlife:</strong>\n    A diverse variety of wildlife species utilize the area. Moose and stone sheep are common to the area as are wolves, and other large predators such as black and grizzly bear.\n  </li>\n</ul>",

In 1806 Simon Fraser brought the fur trade to the area with the establishment of the Stuart Lake Post for the North West Company. The company merged with the Hudson’s Bay Company in 1821, and in 1822 they named the settlement Fort St. James.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    Fort St. James, once the economic capital of the colony of New Caledonia and said to be the oldest European-settled community in British Columbia, saw its importance as a fur trading centre diminish in 1869 when gold was discovered 100 miles north in the Omineca Valley.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    With the miners came a new economic prosperity for the area which has largely been replaced by the forest industry today. Tourism is also growing and hunting and fishing lodges can be found on all three lakes.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Culture:</strong>\n    Prior to Europeans settlement around 200 years ago, the Dakelh-ne people had inhabited the area for generations. To the fur traders, these people became known as the Carrier people, referring to the custom of widows who carried the ashes of cremated husbands with them until a traditional potlach could be held.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    The Carrier traditionally led a semi-nomadic life, congregating along lakes and rivers in the warmer months to pick berries, hunt and tan hides, and catch and process the salmon that was an important staple of their diet. The winter was spent ice fishing and trapping in smaller family units.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    Several Carrier groups reside in the Stuart-Trembleur-Takla lakes area including the Nak’azdli, Yekoochet’en, Takla, and Tl’azt’en. Traditional trails, culturally altered trees, and pictographs can be found throughout the area.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Conservation:</strong>\n    Trembleur Lake Provincial Park preserves for future generations a natural area and contributes to the role of the Stuart-Trembleur-Takla lakes system as a backcountry boating destination area.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Wildlife:</strong>\n    Diversity of the terrain and types of vegetation support abundant wildlife populations in the area. Moose and black bear are plentiful. Other less visible species include mule and white-tail deer, wolf, and grizzly bear. Furbearers in the area include the lynx, fox, beaver, marten, fisher, otter, and wolverine.\n  </li>\n</ul>",

While the northern and eastern portions of the park are relatively dry, the south end of Chilko Lake is characterized by moist areas of the coastal western hemlock zone.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The provincial park was established in February of 1994 as a wilderness area set aside to protect vegetation, wildlife and fish habitats, cultural values, and special features. The diverse ecosystems in the park remain largely undisturbed by human activity, making this park an ecologically significant area in the province. Chilko Lake, the largest, natural high-elevation freshwater lake in Canada, dominates the park.

An historic flume for floating logs to the Adams River from Skmana Lake dates back to the early part of this century. Some of the original timbers that supported the flume are still in place.

Public demand for maintaining recreational opportunities of this area was so strong that BC Hydro contracted a caretaker to maintain the campground, picnic area and boat launch. During this time public pressure for park development at this site grew and following considerable negotiations, a Provincial Park was established in August, 1981.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong>\n    There are no known archaeological sites within the vicinity of Tudyah Lake Park. However, it is likely that the area was used by the Sekani people for hunting and fishing, with the waterways being used as travel and trade routes.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Wildlife:</strong>\n    Within the developed areas of the park, opportunities for viewing wildlife are limited. However, in the natural setting along the Pack River, wildlife such as beaver, otter, muskrat, moose, waterfowl and upland birds may be commonly observed. Although less conspicuous other animals expected to inhabit the area include deer, black bear, moose, wolves, coyotes and fox.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    Tudyah Lake supports a moderate to highly productive fishery with Rainbow trout and Dolly Varden as the popular sport species. Bear Creek has been noted as an important spawning area for trout.\n  </li>\n</ul>",

Local residents built it in the 1950s, after they had been told by the government of the time that it couldn’t be done. However, nowadays it is well-maintained by highways contractors, and, though steep (up to 18% grades), it is passable throughout the year.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The park can also be reached by way of the Discovery Coast passage ferry from Port Hardy on Vancouver Island, or by float plane from Nimpo Lake, Anahim Lake or Bella Coola, or by hiking in the backcountry.\n</p>\n<p>\n  You can obtain fuel, basic supplies, and motel accommodation in Anahim Lake or Nimpo Lake. The nearest RCMP office is in Anahim Lake, where there is also a 24-hour medical clinic. The closest hospital is in Bella Coola, over an hour’s drive from the parking lot.\n</p>\n<h4>Topographic Maps</h4>\nNational Topographic Series Maps 92N/13, 93C/4, 93/5, 93C/12 and 13, 93D/8E and W and 93D/9 and 16 at a scale of 1:50,000 cover the Tweedsmuir area.

      "natureAndCulture": "<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      <strong>History:</strong>\n      This island, originally charted as “Narrow Island”, was named after Capt. Wallace Houstoun, who first surveyed the area in the 1850s. Twisted fruit trees mark the remnants of the garden and orchard planted by Jeremiah Chivers, a Scotsman who retired here after unsuccessful adventures in the interior gold rushes. Chivers lived alone on the island, never marrying, and died here in 1927 at the age of 92.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      After the Second World War, David Conover purchased the island and moved here with his wife Jeanne. The couple developed a very successful holiday resort on Wallace Island, and Conover became a successful author, writing four books – “Once Upon An Island”, “One Man’s Island”, “Sitting On A Saltspring” and “Finding Marilyn, A Resource”. In the first two books he described the couple’s struggles and joys after their purchase of the land in 1946. Their resort, the Royal Cedar Cottages, was advertised as having “a modern well-stocked store, cabins, recreation hall and boat rentals.” In the mid to late 1960s, Conover sold the majority of the island to a group of teachers from Seattle. Disagreements among the owners led to court proceedings and the property was again put up for sale. Wallace Island was purchased through the court ordered sale and became a provincial marine park in 1990 through the cooperative efforts of the provincial government and BC Marine Parks Forever.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Conservation:</strong>\n    The flora of this island is typical of many of the Gulf Islands – with dry summers, many plants are adapted to germinate and grow in the winter, flower in early spring and become dormant by early summer. The best time for botanical viewing is March through May.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Wildlife:</strong>\n    Black-tailed deer are the largest land animals in the park. Sightings of river otters, mink and harbour seals are common. Sea lions can be found in the area in winter, but disappear during the height of the breeding season in July and August. The number of Bald eagles has greatly increased in the area in the last 30 years and are now frequently sighted. Bird watching here is most productive in the spring, winter and fall.\n  </li>\n</ul>",

In the early 1960s, a local helicopter pilot built the original cabin at the lake. The pilot’s cabin eventually succumbed to the ravages of hungry porcupines and time. In the late 1960s, a Catholic Priest prepared a retreat area where spiritual restoration could be obtained. The priest and many others made numerous treks into the solitude of the Wapiti Lake wilderness. In 1983 the BC Forest Service and a Katimivik youth crew upgraded many kilometres of the trail. In 1995 a new cabin was built overlooking the lake. The area was recommended for park status in the Dawson Creek LRMP process and in June 26, 2000 it was established as a Provincial Park.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong>\n    First Nations of the Treaty 8 Tribal Association have traditionally used the area.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Conservation:</strong>\n    Significant stands of old growth spruce forests blanket the slopes of the Hart Ranges in this part of the Rocky Mountains. Important habitat for numerous large species such as mountain goat and grizzly bear can be found in the park’s diverse topography. The park’s tributary streams, rivers and lakes contain numerous fish species. Amongst them, and of particular importance provincially, is the bull trout, a blue listed species. Internationally significant fossils from the Triassic Period have also been uncovered within the park. Fossilized primitive ichthyosaurs found in the area have been found nowhere else on earth. Examples of other ichthyosaurs found in the Wapiti area have also been found in far off locals such as China and Japan.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Wildlife:</strong>\n    An abundance of wildlife can be viewed in Wapiti Lake Provincial Park. Moose are common ungulates found in the park’s many valley bottoms and marshes. Mountain caribou, although less frequently observed, are also found in the park. In the rocky ledges high above the lake, mountain goat can be observed. Both black bear and grizzly bears wander throughout. Wolves, coyotes, lynx and many small mammals pass through or reside in the park.\n  </li>\n</ul>",

Remains of the old log landing site, logging road and an old steam donkey engine can be found on shore at the end of the bay. The bath house building was built in May 1992 by a group of volunteers sponsored by Northern Aquanauts scuba Dive Club and donations from businesses in Kitimat. Prior to being designated as a Provincial Park in 2004, Weewanie Hot Springs was a BC Forest Service Recreation Site maintained by the Kalum Forest District out of Terrace.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"/plan-your-trip/visit-responsibly/wildlife-safety\">\n      General Wildlife, Marine &amp; Outdoor Ethics Information</a>\n  </li>\n</ul>",

Dense forest cover characterizes the lower elevations, with excellent examples of Douglas-fir, western red cedar and hemlock. Wildlife abound with larger animals, such as the grizzly bear, and smaller animals including beaver, wolverine and timber wolf. A wide variety of waterfowl, although not numerous, can also be found in the park.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Wildlife:</strong>\n    Wells Gray is noted for a wide variety of wildlife, including black and grizzly bear, wolf, cougar, lynx, bobcat, wolverine, moose, deer, mountain goat, caribou, plus a host of smaller mammals such as fisher, marten, mink, weasel, squirrel, etc. The bird checklist notes 219 species.\n  </li>\n</ul>",

If you carry on towards middle and upper Joffre Lakes, the trail becomes steeper and more challenging. Evidence of the park’s glacial history can be found in the U-shaped valleys, glacial silts and lateral moraines. This magnificent area of jagged peaks, icefields, cold rushing streams and turquoise blue lakes was established as a recreation area in 1988 and became a Class A park in 1996.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A highlight of the park is the turquoise blue waters of Lower, Middle and Upper Joffre lakes, all three of which are located along the trail, and each more stunning than the last. Their striking, saturated blue colour is caused by “rockflour” – or glacial silt – that is suspended in the water and reflects green and blue wavelengths of sunlight. Joffre Lakes Provincial Park has opportunities for hiking, camping, mountaineering, wildlife viewing, and fishing.\n</p>",

To meet demand for this world class destination, the Berg Lake Trail is 100% reservable in advance of arrival.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The Berg Lake Trail is a world-renowned backcountry hiking trail.

Beyond Kinney Lake, the trail enters the Valley of a Thousand Falls. Fed by the massive Mist, Berg and Robson glaciers, visitors often see huge sections of ice break off or “calve” into the blue/green, silt-laden waters of Berg Lake. Berg Lake campsite is 21 km from the trailhead parking lot.

Banks Island is part of Milbanke Strandflat, a flat low plain, underlain by granite. The topography of this large coastal island is low-lying, but rugged and striated by frequent well-marked lineaments occupied by large expanses of muskeg, where drainage is poor. The conservancy also contains a number of small lakes. This area is important for the traditional harvest of intertidal marine resources by the Gitxaala Nation.\n<br>\n<br>\nOther nearby protected areas include: Lax Kul Nii Luutiksm/Bonilla Conservancy, 6 km to the west; Gitxaala Nii Luutiksm/Kitkatla Conservancy, 15 km to the north; Pa-aat Conservancy on northern Pitt Island, 25 km to the east; and, Monckton Nii Luutiksm Conservancy, 20 km to the southeast. These are all remote backcountry conservancies that include large terrestrial and marine components, except Pa-aat Conservancy, which has a limited coastline.\n<br>\n<br>\nBanks Nii Łuutiksm Conservancy is one of a number of areas that were identified for conservancy status from the North Coast Land and Resource Management Plan (LRMP).

This conservancy was designated in 2006.\n<a href=\"/planning/mgmtplns/nrth_cent_cst/nrth_cntral_coast_pa.html#Newsreleases\" class=\"legacy-link\">\n  See News Release for more information</a>.\n<br>\n<br>\n<h3>Location</h3>\nThe Banks Nii Łuutiksm Conservancy is comprised of 15,585 hectares of upland and 3,536 hectares of foreshore for a total of 19,121 hectares. It is located approximately 20 km south of Kitkatla/Gitxaala and 60 km southwest of Prince Rupert. The conservancy covers the northwest portion of Banks Island. Access to the conservancy is primarily by boat and there are a number of sheltered inlets suitable for anchoring.",

Together with nearby Lax Kul Nii Luutiksm/Bonilla and Gitxaala Nii Luutiksm/Kitkatla conservancies, Banks Nii Łuutiksm Conservancy protects over 48 000 ha of terrestrial and marine habitats on the outer coast.\n<br>\n<br>\nExtensive canopy-forming kelp stands occur on the northern and western marine coastline of Banks Island, and provide important habitat for a diverse community of marine invertebrates and fish. The canopy-forming species include giant kelp and bull kelp. Currently, giant kelp is the most important commercially harvested marine plant on the BC coast and is utilized primarily for the herring spawn-on-kelp fishery. Most of the licences for the spawn-on-kelp fishery are communally held by First Nations.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe Banks Nii Łuutiksm Conservancy area has a long history of use by First Nations groups. Several archaeological sites (fish traps, fish weirs) registered with the BC Archaeological Branch are located in the conservancy. Additional archaeological sites are likely present but archaeological inventories are incomplete. Banks Nii Łuutiksm Conservancy helps protect a historically and currently used area and its associated cultural values, and to provide First Nations with an opportunity to conduct social, ceremonial and cultural uses.",

Captain George Vancouver undertook a voyage of the Pacific Ocean from 1791- 1795, where he surveyed a good portion of the coastline of what is now British Columbia. In 1792, Vancouver, deterred by bad weather from continuing the survey, waited securely in Safety Cove.

Kingfisher, common loon, cormorant and sandpiper occur around Calvert Island and over 100 bird species have been identified in the adjacent Hakai Luxvbalis Conservancy area. The waters surrounding Calvert Island are home to numerous marine mammals such as harbour seals, sea lions, and orcas while Pacific white-sided dolphins frequent Fitz Hugh Sound. The offshore waters are home to minke, gray, and humpback whales as well as porpoises and dolphins.

The basaltic formations and mountain ranges like the Cameron Range combined with very wet hypermaritime climate has led to extensive non-forested alpine and wetlands that often extend to the coast.\n<br>\n<br>\nThere are 18 estuaries in the heritage site/conservancy that spill into some of the most productive marine habitat on Haida Gwaii. This coastline accounts for over 9% of the Herring spawning area (by length of coast) for Haida Gwaii, 35% of the occurrences of kelp forests, and significant eel grass beds. Duu Guusd Heritage Site/Conservancy contains 18% of Haida Gwaii’s fish-bearing freshwater, and streams such as Haines, Jalun and Coates are known to host coho salmon, chum salmon, pink salmon, sockeye salmon, Dolly Varden, steelhead, rainbow trout, cutthroat trout, stickleback, coastrange sculpin and slimy sculpin.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe area hosts numerous listed species including 73 known Peregrine Falcon nest sites (red listed). Important nesting and foraging habitat can be found within this heritage site/conservancy for northern saw-whet owls (Riley Creek – blue listed), northern goshawks (\n<em>\n  Accipiter gentilis laingi\n</em>\n– red listed), marbled murrelets (red listed), ancient murrelet (blue listed), and cassin’s auklet (blue listed).\n<br>\n<br>\nEighty-eight recorded archaeological sites contain an impressive number of cultural items. These include at least 491 known culturally modified trees, shell middens, cobble tools, aboriginal logged trees, cambium stripped hemlock, lithics, cultural depressions, canoes, fire broken rock, habitation features, caves, human remains, smokehouses, cedar withes, rock shelters, house depressions, burial sites, burial boxes, burial houses, carved figures and planked trees. Many of these areas have not been inventoried thoroughly which indicates that the heritage site/conservancy likely contains many other unrecorded cultural heritage and archaeological sites.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe cultural heritage values in the heritage site/conservancy include opportunities for the ongoing continuance of Haida culture through traditional use of the area. Some examples of traditional use within Duu Guusd Heritage Site/Conservancy may include monumental cedar and cedar bark harvesting, seaweed harvesting, medicinal plant harvesting, hunting, fishing, trapping and food gathering. The heritage site/conservancy also provides a place for the physical expression of culture through monumental art such as totems or establishment of traditional style infrastructure such as longhouses.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe remote location of Duu Guusd Heritage Site/Conservancy provides an excellent opportunity to maintain biological diversity and natural environment values. Of concern, though, is the presence of introduced mammals of which raccoons, Norway rats and black-tailed deer pose a threat to local ecosystems. There is also occurrence of sowthistle, a non-native invasive plant, in the heritage site/conservancy.",

The conservancy provides safe boat anchorages for boaters travelling along the North Coast and good opportunities for recreation activities and wildlife viewing.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong>\n    The Gitxaala Nii Luutiksm/Kitkatla Conservancy lies within the traditional territory of the Gitxaała Nation.&nbsp; Members of the Gitxaała Nation have lived along the north coast of British Columbia for more than 10,000 years. The territory of the Gitxaała Nation extends from\n    <em>\n      Lax Kxeen\n    </em>\n    (Prince Rupert) in the north then south to Princess Royal Island and extends from Hecate Straight in the west then\n    <em>\n      eastward\n    </em>\n    to include the lower reaches of the (Skeena River). Prior to European contact, the Gitxaała people lived in villages located throughout the territory. Seasonal campsites were located in strategic locations to facilitate utilization of natural resources. The central home for the Gitxaała is now the main village on\n    <em>\n      Lax Klan\n    </em>\n    (Dolphin Island).\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    Gitxaala means “people of the salt,” which is a reference to the ocean-front location of the Gitxaala community on Dolphin Island. Nii Luutiksm means “a special or treasured area.” Gitxaala/Kitkatla Inlet provides a wealth of traditional resources that have for millennia sustained the Gitxaała. Traditional harvesting of seaweed, roe-on-kelp, cockles and salmon are some of the practices that continue to occur within this inlet. The area’s oral history, stone fish-weirs and cache pits within this conservancy represent a history that predates European contact. Protection of cultural uses and values is a dominant feature of this conservancy.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    The traditional hereditary system of governance is one of the main structures of Gitxaała society for cultural, economic and political purposes. The\n    <em>\n      Wil ‘na ‘tał\n    </em>\n    (House Unit), led by a\n    <em>\n      Sm gyigyet\n    </em>\n    (House Chief) has been the primary unit of each village. Each House in turn is affiliated with one of the four Clans:\n    <em>\n      G̱anhada\n    </em>\n    (raven),\n    <em>\n      Gisbutwada\n    </em>\n    (blackfish),\n    <em>\n      Lax Sgyiik\n    </em>\n    (eagle) and\n    <em>\n      Lax Gyibuu\n    </em>\n    (wolf). There are currently 26 house groups within the Gitxaała Nation. Each house has the right to use, and the responsibility to manage, specified land within the larger Gitxaała Nation traditional territory. Throughout time the entire territory has been occupied, and resources managed and utilized, according to the laws, traditions and customs of the people. Resources were traded between house groups and with other Tsimshian villages. In recent times the Gitxaała Government has incorporated an elected Band Council to work with the Hereditary House Chiefs in governing the Gitxaała territory.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    The Gitxaała Nation continues to respect the allocation of resources, management of the land and cultural use of the land at the House level. Each House leader, Chief, is responsible for management of the land holdings of their House to ensure that the land and natural resources are managed in a manner that will provide for future generations.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    Northern portions of the Gitxaala Nii Luutiksm/Kitkatla Conservancy are of importance and part of the asserted traditional territories of the Coast Tsimshian which includes both the Metlakatla and Lax Kw’alaams First Nations. Kwil-Mas (North Porcher Island) is an intensive traditional use area for within the traditional territory of the Gitwylgiots Tribe and of importance for the harvest of roe-on-kelp and other sea resources.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    Use the below links for information or to contact the Gitxaala First Nation:\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"http://gitxaalanation.com/\">\n          Gitxaala Nation</a>\n        <br>\n        PO Box 149\n        <br>\n        Kitkatla, BC, V0V 1C0\n        <br>\n        Phone: 250-848-2214\n        <br>\n        Fax: 250-848-2238\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <u>\n          <a href=\"http://metlakatla.ca/\">\n            Metlakatla Stewardship Office</a>\n        </u>\n        <br>\n        P.O.

The high levels of use are a result of the high salmon and wildlife habitat values centered on Hanna and Tintina Creeks, and the resulting high subsistence and cultural values.

These include at least 77 known culturally modified trees, a pre-contact cabin, lithics, fire-cracked rock, limpets, clams, thumbnail stone blade, cultural depression, a plank house, an aboriginally logged stump, and one five pound stone. Many of these areas have not been inventoried thoroughly which indicates that the heritage site/conservancy likely contains many other unrecorded cultural heritage and archaeological sites.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The protected low gradient shoreline and fine-textured soils have resulted in the development of highly productive estuarine vegetation.

Much of the area is exposed at low tide, and the resulting sheltered and productive habitats are important migration, rearing and feeding areas for many wildlife species using the area.\n</p>\n<p>\n  There are three estuaries within the Kamdis area. The southern marine area is dominated by warm shallow, sandy and flat bottom physiography typified by low current and low exposure. The northern marine area is recognized by Fisheries and Oceans Canada as one of the coast’s most unique marine ecosystems, characterized by warm shallow, flat-bottomed physiography typified by high current and low exposure.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Salmon species that utilize this area include coho, pink and Chinook salmon. Cutthroat trout, Dolly Varden and steelhead trout are also present in most of the small streams entering Kumdis Slough and Kumdis River. Stickleback, crab, shrimp and most shellfish are common, and the area is particularly important to larval forms of invertebrates due to its sheltered location. Fauna such as river otter, marten, and weasel frequent the area.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The area hosts numerous listed species such as Marbled murrelets (red listed), Northern goshawk (red listed), sandhill cranes (blue listed), Great Blue heron (blue listed), Peregrine falcons (red listed). A baseline of marine birds were surveyed for the Kumdis slough by Ducks Unlimited in 1991. Other foraging birds recorded along the Kamdis slough are bufflehead, common merganser, and trumpeter swan.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Of recent concern is the presence of introduced mammals of which black-tailed deer, beavers and raccoons pose a threat to local ecosystems and species.

Duncan spent from May to August 1788 trading for sea otter skins between Queen Charlotte Island and Princess Royal Island.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong>\n    Kitasoo Spirit Bear is in the asserted territories of the Kitasoo, Heiltsuk and Gitxaala First Nations. In the late 19th century, the Kitasoo and XaiXais people came together to settle in Klemdulxk (Klemtu), meaning ‘blocked passage’ in the Tsimshian language. Kitasoo Bay is the original home of the Kitasoo people (Tsimshian) with old village sites, burial grounds and very high archaeological and heritage values. There are over 100 documented ancient cultural sites within the Kitasoo/XaiXais traditional territory including abandoned native villages, fish traps, culturally modified trees and middens. Structural remains including charred wooden boards and badly decayed boards were recovered from a prehistoric house at Grant Anchorage.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Conservation:</strong>\n    The Kitasoo Spirit Bear Conservancy contributes to a network of protection areas capturing a cross section of biodiversity and provides good representation of the transition between the Hectate Lowlands and Kitimat Ranges Ecosections. The primary role of the conservancy is the protection and conservation of the Kermode bear along with rare and special ecosystems and cultural heritage values. The conservancy provides ecological connectivity with Kitlope and Fiordland through the Khuze and Green watersheds. Special features protected within the conservancy include an example of recent volcanism (Kitasoo Hill), salmonid streams, migration habitat values for waterfowl and possible karst formations.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Wildife:</strong>\n    The highest concentration of Kermode bears are found in the Kitasoo Spirit Bear Conservancy consisting of approximately 10% of the black bear population. Laredo Inlet serves as an important feeding site for red listed marbled murrelets and has an abundance of bald eagle nests. Thriving seabird colonies of puffins, murres and cormorants populate the windswept outer islands. Colourful seabirds such as Oystercatchers, Pigeon Guillemots and Rhinoceros Auklets are common as well as large numbers of smaller water birds, such as Phalaropes. The waters around this conservancy are utilized by orcas, humpback whales, Stellar sea lions, sea otters, elephant seals, and porpoises. The area is home to black bears, mountain goats, deer, ravens, foxes and a significant population of grey wolves. Grizzly bears are not common but have been sighted in the area.\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"/plan-your-trip/visit-responsibly/wildlife-safety\">\n          General Wildlife, Marine &amp; Outdoor Ethics Information</a>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>",

It is now the site of a Haida Watchmen camp.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Environment Canada, The Laskeek Bay Conservation Society (LBCS) and the Research Group on Introduced Species (RGIS) have monitored seabirds, shorebirds, marine mammals, and cavity nesting birds as well as conducted plant inventories on Limestone Island and surrounding areas. These studies have documented important ecological baselines, quantified impacts on native species from introduced species, and continues to inform land management through respected academic and civilian science.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The remote location of Ḵ’uuna Gwaay Heritage Site/Conservancy provides an excellent opportunity to maintain biological diversity and natural environment values. Of ongoing concern is the presence of introduced mammals. For example, Black-tailed deer, squirrels, Norway rats and raccoons pose a threat to local ecosystems and species. In addition, several non-native invasive plants have been recorded on Limestone Island including burdock, bull thistle, sowthistle, and common crupina.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The marine foreshore area and marine environment is highly biologically diverse, providing high value habitat for important marine species and includes six harbour seal haulouts and three Stellar sea lion haulouts. Limestone Island is a deposit of pure limestone that consists of massive grey crystalline limestone. South Low Island also has a limestone outcrop. The limestone outcrops on Limestone and South Low islands create unique habitats for rare and endemic plants. The deer-free status of Low and South Low islands allows for vegetation growth that is rarely found elsewhere on Haida Gwaii.\n</p>",

Some examples of traditional use within Ḵ’uuna Gwaay Heritage Site/Conservancy may include monumental cedar and cedar bark harvesting, seaweed harvesting, medicinal plant harvesting, hunting, fishing, trapping and food gathering.

The area contains rich and diverse intertidal and marine resources that support extensive Coast Tsimshian harvesting for food, social, ceremonial and economic purposes. The islands contain numerous campsites, some of historical importance, and many still in use by Coast Tsimshian members for seasonal harvesting of marine and land resources.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The fauna of the Conservancy may vary among the islands, and includes wolves, mink, river otter, weasel, and beaver. Deer are not known to occur.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In the marine area, canopy forming kelp stands occur along the coastline and provide important habitat for a diverse community of marine invertebrates and fishes. Harbour porpoises, Pacific White-Sided Dolphins, Northern Resident Killer Whales and Humpback Whales can be seen in the area. There are four known Stellar Sea Lion haulouts.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Rocky islets in Lax Kwaxl, including Connel Island, Simpson Rocks, Green Island and Grey Island, contain seabird colonies containing pigeon guillemot, black oystercatcher, glaucous-winged gull. Other bird species include bald eagle, goldeneye, bufflehead and harlequin.\n</p>",

The very wet coastal hemlock forest on the archipelago is a significant breeding area for a variety of seabirds. The rhinoceros auklet is the most abundant seabird on Lucy Islands and builds underground burrows to nest. These nests are very sensitive to disturbance, which is why it’s very important to stay on the boardwalk.\n</p>\n<p>\n  To fully enjoy Lucy Islands, visitors must respect and understand these values and the rules to protect them.

The “Cordilla” claims of 1920 targeted pyritized quartz veins containing gold and silver on the west side of Drake Inlet, near Cornwall Inlet. From 1921-1922, a 91 metre adit was driven along a mineralized shear zone. The “Campania” claims of 1920 targeted partly mineralized quartz veins containing copper, silver and gold near Leading Point on the northwest side of Princess Royal Island.

The Kermode Bear (\n    <em>\n      Ursus americanus kermodei\n    </em>\n    ), also known as the “Spirit Bear”, is a subspecies of the American Black Bear living in the central and north coast of British Columbia and noted for about 1/10 of their population having white or cream-colored fur. This color variant is due to a unique recessive trait in their gene pool – they are neither albino nor related to polar bears. The Kermode Bear was named after Francis Kermode, former director of the Royal B.C. Museum who researched the species. Because of their ghost-like appearance, “Spirit Bear” hold a prominent place the First Nations mythology of the area and is known to them as Moksgm’ol.

The W¢oshtin wudidaa was adopted by a Taku River Tlingit First Nation Joint Clan Resolution and jointly approved by the Province and the Taku River Tlingit First Nation in July 2011. The conservancy is named and described in Schedule E of the Protected Areas of British Columbia Act.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong>\n    Monarch Mountain/A X‚egi Deiyi Conservancy lies within the traditional territory of the Taku River Tlingit First Nation. The Tlingit name “A Xéegi Deiyi” (pronounced “A-hee-ged day”) means the shoulder trail, which extends from the beach on Atlin Lake shoreline to the small lakes at the top of Monarch Mountain. According to Elder Jackie Williams, the rock outcropping is called shoulder rock because the shoulder is a strong part of the body, and this trail is a strong and powerful journey for people seeking healing and wellness. It is important to respect the privacy of people who travel to the two small lakes on the summit plateau for spiritual activities.\n    <p>\n      Three archaeological sites at the base of the “A Xéegi Deiyi” trail found just outside of the conservancy boundary highlight the significance of the area. These sites are at the mouth of Pine Creek (a key grayling gathering place) and are important spiritual sites for prayer and cleansing ceremonies. In addition to the trail and archaeological sites, documented Tlingit traditional uses include berry picking, hunting and trapping.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Conservation:</strong>\n    Monarch Mountain/A X‚egi Deiyi Conservancy lies within the Yukon Southern Lakes Ecoregion. This ecoregion is characterized by a gently rolling upland, with wide valleys separating isolated mountains. In the past, this area was largely covered by glaciers that moved northward off the Boundary Ranges to the southwest where they came into contact with glaciers from the Skeena Mountains.\n    <p>\n      The dominant ecosystem in the Monarch Mountain/A X‚egi Deiyi Conservancy is the spruce-willow-birch shrublands. An area of Boreal White and Black Spruce also occurs on the lower slopes on the western side of the conservancy.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Wildlife:</strong>\n    Wildlife diversity in the Monarch Mountain/A X‚egi Deiyi Conservancy is limited by the harsh climate typical of the spruce-willow-birch ecosystem. These high elevation plateaus are not highly used in winter. However, a large variety of wildlife species, including ungulates, large carnivores, small mammals, raptors, song birds, and a host of invertebrate species, use the area in the snow-free months.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"/plan-your-trip/visit-responsibly/wildlife-safety\">\n      Wildlife, Marine &amp; Outdoor Ethics Information</a>\n  </li>\n</ul>",

The Masset Sound shoreline is exposed to winds and wave action from the north, while further to the south, by Maast Island, the shoreline is more protected by Dixon Entrance. In a shallow narrow channel to the west of Maast Island profuse eelgrass beds form a ‘hanging lagoons’.

Steelhead and Dolly Varden are also found in the area.

Many of these areas have not been inventoried thoroughly which indicates that the conservancy may contain many other unrecorded cultural heritage and archaeological sites.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    The cultural heritage values in the heritage site/conservancy include opportunities for the ongoing continuance of Haida culture through traditional use of the area. Some examples of traditional use within Yaaguun Suu Heritage Site/Conservancy may include monumental cedar and cedar bark harvesting, medicinal plant harvesting, hunting, fishing, trapping and food gathering. The heritage site/conservancy also provides a place for the physical expression of culture through monumental art such as totems.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Conservation:</strong>\n    The area has some of the most productive Sitka spruce alluvial forests on Haida Gwaii and constitutes a high representation for Yellow cedar-Mountain hemlock/Hellebore and Western red cedar-Sitka spruce/Salal ecological communities.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    One red listed species, the Queen Charlotte aven (Geum schofieldii) has two occurrence records for the area.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    Yaaguun Suu Heritage Site/Conservancy contains fish-bearing streams that are known to have Sockeye Salmon, Chinook Salmon, Coho Salmon, Chum Salmon, Pink Salmon, Steelhead, Dolly Varden and Cutthroat Trout. The Yakoun River in particular is a major salmon-bearing stream on which large amounts of fish stock data are available.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    Yakoun Lake hosts Coastrange Sculpin, Coho Salmon, Cutthroat Trout, Dolly Varden, Pacific Lamprey, Pink Salmon, Prickly Sculpin, Sockeye Salmon, Steelhead and 3-spine Stickleback. The lake has a mean depth of 35 m (max. 91 m) and has significant salmonid stocks, with exceptional habitat supported by the surrounding old growth forests (65.6% of conservancy area).\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    Northern Goshawks (Laingi subspecies) and Marbled Murrelets are red listed species and are known to inhabit the area. Of recent concern is the presence of introduced mammals, such as Black-tailed Deer, which pose an increasing threat to local ecosystems and species. Bull thistle, an alien invasive plant, has been identified as occurring within the area.\n  </li>\n</ul>",

      "description": "Juan de Fuca Provincial Park on the west coast of southern Vancouver Island offers scenic beauty, spectacular hiking, marine and wildlife viewing and roaring surf in its course along the Pacific coastline of the Strait of Juan de Fuca.\n<br>\n<br>\nThere are four main areas to the park: the China Beach Campground, the Juan de Fuca Marine Trail, the China Beach day-use area and Botanical Beach.\n<br>\n<br>\nA major feature of this park, the Juan de Fuca Marine Trail, follows 47 kilometres of wilderness stretching along the western shoreline of the southern Island. There are four trailheads to the\n<a href=\"hiking#hiking\">\n  Juan de Fuca Trail</a>\nat Juan de Fuca East (<a href=\"trailhd\" class=\"legacy-link\">\n  China Beach</a>),\n<a href=\"trailhd\" class=\"legacy-link\">\n  Sombrio Beach</a>,\n<a href=\"trailhd\" class=\"legacy-link\">\n  Parkinson Creek</a>\nand\n<a href=\"trailhd\" class=\"legacy-link\">\n  Botanical Beach</a>. Although most of the Juan de Fuca Marine Trail is designed for strenuous day or multi-day hiking/camping in this rugged and isolated area, some easy to moderate day hiking opportunities to the beach or along the trail are available starting from the trailheads.\n<br>\n<br>\nAt the east end of the park you’ll find the vehicle accessible China Beach Campground and the China Beach day-use area. The campground is located in a forested area with open understory, about 1 km east of the China Beach day-use area and the Juan de Fuca East (China Beach) Trailhead. Trails connect the campground to China Beach and the adjacent smaller Second Beach, located east of the larger China Beach day-use.\n<br>\n<br>\nAt the west end of Juan de Fuca Park is Botanical Beach, one of the richest tidal areas along the west coast. Botanical Beach also has a unique shoreline framed by ridges of shale and quartz, which jut up through the black basalt to form huge tableaus. Botanical Beach is the western terminus for the Juan de Fuca Marine Trail and a popular day trip destination for visitors wishing to observe this sensitive and unique ecosystem. Wildlife viewing is best done at low tide, when visitors can walk out across the flat sandstone and granite outcroppings to view tide pools filled with brightly coloured marine life.\n<br>\n<br>\nWhen visiting Botanical Beach, please look in the tide pools only – do not touch the marine life. Do not remove, collect or disturb any tide pool life, shells, plants, flowers, kelp, etc. Even touching the water in a tide pool with sunscreen on your hands can create an “oil slick” that could kill the vulnerable creatures in this sensitive ecosystem. Remember to bring your camera, as photographs make great souvenirs.\n<br>\n<br>\nJuan de Fuca Provincial Park offers ample opportunity to view larger marine mammals as well, including Grey and killer whales, which can often be spotted feeding just off the points. The best time to see Grey whales is during their migration from the Mexican coast to Alaska in March and April. Seals and sea lions can also often be seen playing offshore.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Special Features:\n</strong>This park contains numerous special natural features, including waterfalls, grottos, old growth forest, estuaries, tide pools and shale and quartz rock formations.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Park Size:</strong>\n1,528 hectares\n<br>\n<br>\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th colspan=\"2\">\n        Campground Dates of Operation\n        <div>\n          All dates are subject to change without notice\n        </div>\n      </th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <strong>Opening and Closing Campground Dates:</strong>\n        <br>\n        (campground is accessible but may not offer full services such as water, security, etc.)\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        May 15 – September 15\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        – China Beach campground\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        May 15 â€“ September 15 (campground gate is closed during the off-season)\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        – Juan de Fuca trail; wilderness campsites\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        All year\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <strong>Campground Dates with Full Services and Fees:</strong>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        – China Beach campground\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        May 15 – September 2\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        – Juan de Fuca trail; wilderness campsites\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        All year\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <strong>Campground Reservable Dates:</strong>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        China Beach only:\n        <br>\n        May 15 â€“ September 2\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <strong>Total Number of Vehicle Accessible Campsites:\n        </strong>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        China Beach only: 78\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <strong>Number of Reservable Campsites, if applicable:</strong>\n        <br>\n        (all remaining sites are first-come, first-served)\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        China Beach only: 47\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td colspan=\"2\">\n        <strong>Note:</strong>\n        The above information is for the campground only.

      "natureAndCulture": "<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>History</strong>\n    - The Juan de Fuca Marine Trail was created through the Commonwealth Nature Legacy as an enduring reminder of the 1994 Victoria Commonwealth Games. Preservation of a living legacy of unprecedented natural beauty, accessible to all, was considered a fitting tribute to the spirit of the Games.\n    <br>\n    Construction and preservation of the Trail has been made possible by the efforts of government, local industries, First Nations and citizens. Land exchanges and gifts of land have come from Western Forest Products and Timber West. Trail upgrades have been undertaken with funding from Forest Renewal BC and the Environment Youth Team (E-Team). The Juan de Fuca Marine Trail was originally part of a lifesaving trail that serviced this area, known at the time as the Graveyard of the Pacific.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Conservation</strong>\n    - The park protects significant marine tidal pool life at Botanical Beach as well as black bear and cougar habitat. The region is so biologically significant that the University of Minnesota installed the first marine research station in the Pacific Northwest at Botanical Beach in 1901.

      "description": "<p>\n  Kakwa Protected Area showcases ice-clad mountains, extensive alpine meadows and a section of the Continental Divide. Main physical features include Mount Sir Alexander (3270 m), Mount Ida (3189 m) and Kakwa Lake.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Summer activities include camping, hiking, fishing, and horseback trips. Winter activities include snowmobiling and wilderness ski tours. The wide range of species diversity gives excellent opportunity for wildlife viewing. Visitors interested in photography will appreciate the incredible beauty of the remote area. Winter visitors should note limited access routes apply.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Kakwa Provincial Park, together with Kakwa Wildlands Park in Alberta and Willmore Wilderness Park in Alberta, make up the first Interprovincial Park for B.C. and Alberta called “<a href=\"kakwa_willmore2007.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"legacy-link\">\n    Kakwa – Willmore Interprovincial Park [PDF 1.2MB]\n  </a>.”\n</p>\n<p>\n  More information on the Alberta parks, Kakwa Wildlands and Willmore Wilderness parks:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"http://www.albertaparks.ca/kakwa.aspx\">\n      Kakwa Wildlands Park</a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"http://www.albertaparks.ca/willmore.aspx\">\n      Willmore Wilderness Park</a>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>\n  Special Notes\n</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    There are two areas at the south end of Kakwa Lake that have been designated for camping: one is for hiker traffic (West side of Wapumun Creek) and the other is for horse traffic (East side of Wapumum Creek). These sites each have a pit toilet and fire circle, horse users are requested to cross Wapumun Creek at one specially marked location\n    <strong>only</strong>: at the blue bamboo poles near the north end of the creek where it flows into Kakwa Lake. The creek is a<strong>\n      crucial</strong>\n    spawning creek for the Rainbow trout that inhabit Kakwa Lake, and horses crossing along the creek would damage the spawning beds. Horse users please avoid this area with your horses as this area is a source of drinking water for park visitors. The park is a user maintained park, so pack out whatever you have packed into the park. Please cooperate and help to keep the park pristine for future visitors.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    During the summer of 2007 there were two new cabins constructed at the south end of Kakwa Lake (the old cabins have been removed); one is open for public use and the other is the park headquarters used by park rangers and volunteer park hosts. The public cabin is open on a first-come first-serve basis year-round and is open to all park users, this cabin is equipped with a woodstove, table and bench, accommodations for approximately 10 people with sleeping platforms and a loft, and a counter with storage underneath the counter top. Please note this cabin doubles as an emergency shelter and warming hut, so please keep it clean and in better shape than found. Please dump gray water into the pit toilet that is located near the cabin.\n  </li>\n</ul>",

The park offers visitors a chance to explore many unique and interesting features of a volcanic landscape and to learn about the culture and legends of the Nisg̱a’a people.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <a href=\"#InterpretivePrograms\">\n    The Nisg̱a’a Visitor Centre offers guided walks to the volcanic crater</a>\n</p>\n<p>\n  Just outside of the protected area, there are five communities, four of which are Nisg̱a’a villages. Their names are Gitlakdamix (New Aiyansh), Gitwinksihlkw (Canyon City), Lakalzap (Greenville), Kincolith and Nass Camp. All communities are road accessible from the protected area. Within the communities there are amenities like: grocery stores, bed and breakfasts, restaurants, gift shops, gas stations and health services.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Special Features:</strong>\n  Anhluut’ukwsim Lax̱mihl Angwinga’asanskwhl Nisg̱a’a (Nisg̱a’a Memorial Lava Bed Park) is the first provincial park within the Province of British Columbia established to combine interpretation of natural features and native culture. The park is included in the landmark treaty, the “Nisg̱a’a Final Agreement”, between the Government of Canada and the Nisg̱a’a Nation. Nisg̱a’a Memorial Lava Bed Park is also the first provincial park to be jointly managed by a First Nation and BC Parks.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The Nisg̱a’a alkali basalt flow is one of the youngest and most accessible volcanic features in British Columbia. The guided volcanic tours offer the park visitor a chance to hike 3 km through a scenic old growth forest and past a variety of volcanic features to a viewpoint overlooking the crater. To protect the special features of the area, unguided access to the volcanic cone is prohibited. The hike is rated as moderate with some hills and steep stairs.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Geological History:</strong>\n  As the lava spilled from the crater an estimated 250 years ago, it followed a creek bed downslope to Lava Lake and down the Tseax Valley to the Nass River. The lava travelled at different speeds depending on the steepness of the slope. Some types of lava flow and interesting features include:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Tree cast – formed by burned out tree trunks leaving holes in the lava.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Lava tube – formed as the top layer cooled and hardened. The crust insulated the lava flowing inside which eventually flowed out leaving the crust as the roof and walls of the tube.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Pahoehoe – lava that often has a smooth surface or is ropey in form.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    AA – rough and jagged lava.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Blocky – large chunks of lava.\n  </li>\n</ul>",

It also includes the Chicadee watershed and areas important for a number of species at risk including the Taylor’s Checkerspot butterfly.\n</p>\n<h4>Denman Island Park Butterfly Reserve Receives Wetland Makeover\n</h4>\n<p>\n  BC Parks plays an important role in providing habitat for many species, including species at risk. Wetlands and wet meadows are one of those key ecosystems that support rare butterflies like the Taylor’s Checkerspot butterfly. BC Parks has been working with partners to restore wetlands in Denman Island Park and Protected Area that have been impacted by past logging, changes in hydrology and invasive plants. Planting native species, removing invasives and rebuilding wetlands are just some of the activities that are restoring this area. This project has been a great opportunity to engage a range of partners. Local residents provided their site knowledge, the K’ómoks First Nation participated as a cultural monitor during construction, and the BC Wildlife Federation held a Wetlands Institute providing an educational opportunity for participants. This project is made possible with the collaborative effort of the Taylor’s Checkerspot Butterfly Recovery Project Team. BC Parks supported this project through the Licence Plate Program and funding was also provided by Habitat Conservation Trust Foundation.

The geothermal hot springs cascade down a waterfall into half a dozen rocky pools. These pools flow from one level to the next becoming gradually cooler as the fresh spring water is cooled by ocean swells. Interpretive signs posted along the boardwalk to the hotsprings provide information about the geology and thermal features of the park.\n</p>",

      "safetyInfo": "<h4>Stay Safe</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Boardwalk can be wet and slippery.</strong>\n    Please be advised that the wooden boardwalk to the hot springs can be wet and slippery. Park visitors should wear good footwear and be mindful of the conditions when travelling in the park.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    The two kilometre\n    <strong>boardwalk to the hotsprings may not be suitable for all people</strong>. The boardwalk includes numerous sections of stairs and has many steps that could be physically challenging for some visitors. Access to the pools is through a rock strewn area and may also pose challenges due to the uneven footing.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Avoid times of high tides and high swells.</strong>\n    During winter high tides, the pools fill with cold sea water. Rough water and floating wood debris may cause bodily harm to bathers. Plan your visits to the springs to avoid times of high tides and high swells. Check with the tour operator, air carrier or water taxi before you start your trip.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Special Notes</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    There is a day-use fee of $3.00 per person per day.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Camping and fires are prohibited in the hot springs area\n    </strong>at the southern part of Openit Peninsula in the park.

Please ensure the company you hire is legally operating in the park.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Notice to Vessel Operators</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Maquinna dock overnight fee is in effect. This applies to all vessels mooring overnight.</strong>\n    “Vessel” means a boat, canoe, kayak or other craft used, or capable of being used, for navigation on water. Maquinna Marine Park day-use fee is not included in the purchase of a docking permit.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Moorage:</strong>\n    $2.00 per metre, per night (includes taxes). Rafting of vessels is not permitted.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Fee Payment:</strong>\n    Either a park attendant may collect the docking fee or payment can be made at the self-registration fee station located next to the on shore park entrance Information Shelter.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Reserved Space:</strong>\n    Reserving dock space is not permitted, red painted tie rails and signage restricts dock space for park ranger vessels, or loading zones for authorized vessels and float plane.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Vessel Size:</strong>\n    Docking at this facility is restricted to vessels under 12m in length, larger vessels must anchor away from dock.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Maximum Stay:</strong>\n    Maximum length of stay is 14 days per calendar year.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Tsunamis</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Tsunamis are a series of unusually big waves caused by a large-scale disturbance of a body of water. If you are on the beach and feel strong shaking from an earthquake or if the water suddenly recedes, move immediately to higher ground (greater than 15 metres or 45 feet above the tide line). There is no way to be certain how high a tsunami is going to be. The first wave to arrive at the coast is often not the largest, and each wave may be separated by up to an hour or more. Waves may continue for up to twelve hours, so you must stay on high ground until advised otherwise. Do not go to the beach to watch.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Reporting damage</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Please report any damage, disturbance or irregularities in the park to:\n    <br>\n    <a href=\"http://www.mhssahousaht.ca/\">\n      Ahous Business Corporation</a>\n    <br>\n    250 725-2169\n    <br>\n    <a href=\"mailto:info@mhssahousaht.ca\">\n      info@mhssahousaht.ca</a>\n  </li>\n</ul>",

      "description": "<p>\n  For an experience rich in history, culture and entertainment, do what people have been doing since the 1930s—hop on a boat to Saysutshun (Newcastle Island Marine) Provincial Park, one of the most intriguing parks in B.C. Bring your own boat or take the passenger ferry from Nanaimo—a 10 minute ride that deposits passengers on Newcastle Island, located just a few hundred metres offshore from Vancouver Island. From a distance you’ll see an island shoreline dominated by steep sandstone cliffs and ledges, interspersed with sunny beaches – a marked contrast to the interior of the island, which is studded with mature Douglas fir, Garry oak, arbutus and Big Leaf maple trees.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Visitors to Newcastle Island can choose from an extensive network of walking/hiking trails that lead to various historic points around the island. Indigenous middens offer mute evidence of at least two Salish villages, which were deserted before the discovery of coal in this area in 1849. Subsequent decades saw the island’s fortunes rise and fall as it went through various incarnations while supporting a fish-salting operation, a sandstone quarry and a shipyard.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In 1931 the Canadian Pacific Steamship Company purchased the island and operated it as a pleasure resort, building a dance pavilion – now the visitor center – a teahouse, picnic areas, change houses, a soccer field and a wading pool. An old ship was tied to the dock at Mark Bay and served as a floating hotel. The island became very popular for company picnics and Sunday outings, with ships from Vancouver bringing as many as 1,500 people at a time. The advent of the Second World War, however, caused a decrease in the number of ships available for pleasure excursions and Newcastle Island suffered a consequent decline in popularity.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Today, park services and facilities include walk-in campsites complete with flush toilets and showers, as well as facilities for group camping and picnicking. The Pavilion can also be rented for dances, corporate picnics and wedding receptions.\n</p>\n<h5>\n  Special Notes\n</h5>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    A park interpreter is in attendance during the summer to provide visitor information and to interpret the island’s unique human and natural history. Contact the Park Operator for information about dates, time of walks, talks and other program details.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    The Pavilion may be booked for use by\n    <a href=\"/reservations/group-camping\">\n      groups and organizations</a>.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Saysutshun (Newcastle Island Marine) Provincial Park benefits from excellent adjoining commercial facilities. Shopping, recreation and entertainment are available in the nearby city of Nanaimo. During July the annual Nanaimo- Bathtub Race departs from the Inner Harbour. Petroglyph Provincial Park, just south of the city, has some excellent native rock carvings. There are a variety of marinas offering boats and fishing gear to take advantage of the plentiful salmon in the surrounding waters. At Departure Bay is the Pacific Biological Research Station, which has public displays.\n  </li>\n</ul>",

      "natureAndCulture": "<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      <strong>History:</strong>\n      A brief walk around Newcastle brings you to the site of Saysutshun Village, where recovered native artifacts bear silent witness to the life of a Salish village that was deserted some time before coal was discovered in 1849. For centuries the Salish had occupied this village between the months of September and April, leaving every spring in order to fish for cod and gather clams and tubers on Gabriola Island. Although the Salish were among the island’s first coal miners, they were soon “supplemented” by boatloads of British; these men christened the island after a famous coal town in northern England and diligently worked the mines until 1883. Newcastle Island’s supplies of sandstone lasted longer than did the coal: this attractive building material, used in many constructions along the west coast, was quarried from 1869 until 1932.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Newcastle Island also played a role in the fishing industry of the province. By 1910 the Japanese, who dominated fisheries, had established a small settlement just north of Shaft Point on the west side of the island. Here they operated a saltery and shipyard until 1941 when all the Japanese-Canadians who lived along the coast were sent to internment camps in the Interior.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      In 1931, the Canadian Pacific Steamship Company purchased the island and operated it as a pleasure resort, building a dance pavilion (now the visitor centre), teahouse, picnic areas, change-houses, soccer field and a wading pool. An old ship named Charmer (later replaced by the Princess Victoria) was tied to the dock at Mark Bay (Echo Bay) and served as a floating hotel. The island became very popular for company picnics and Sunday outings, with ships from Vancouver bringing as many as 1,500 people at a time. The advent of the Second World War caused a decrease in the number of ships available for pleasure excursions and Newcastle Island suffered a consequent decline in popularity.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong>\n    Newcastle Island provided a home to the Coast Salish native peoples prior to the discovery of coal in 1849.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Conservation:</strong>\n    The park offers an island shoreline dominated by steep sandstone cliffs and ledges punctuated by beaches and provide a marked contrast to the interior of the island studded with Douglas fir, arbutus, Garry oak and Big Leaf maple trees.\n  </li>\n</ul>",

Wetlands and wet meadows are one of those key ecosystems that support rare butterflies like the Taylor’s Checkerspot butterfly. BC Parks has been working with partners to restore wetlands in Denman Island Park and Protected Area that have been impacted by past logging, changes in hydrology and invasive plants. Planting native species, removing invasives and rebuilding wetlands are just some of the activities that are restoring this area. This project has been a great opportunity to engage a range of partners. Local residents provided their site knowledge, the K’ómoks First Nation participated as a cultural monitor during construction, and the BC Wildlife Federation held a Wetlands Institute providing an educational opportunity for participants. This project is made possible with the collaborative effort of the Taylor’s Checkerspot Butterfly Recovery Project Team. BC Parks supported this project through the Licence Plate Program and funding was also provided by Habitat Conservation Trust Foundation.

      "description": "<p>\n  Tatshenshini-Alsek is considered to be one of the most magnificent river systems on earth, and forms the basis of the British Columbia provincial park that bears its name. Tatshenshini-Alsek Park contains nearly one million hectares of glacier-cloaked peaks, wild rivers, grizzly bears and unusual plant communities. Situated in the very northwest corner of British Columbia, it nestles between Kluane National Park and Reserves in the Yukon and Glacier Bay &amp; Wrangell-St. Elias National Parks and Preserves in Alaska. Combined, these parks comprise the largest protected area in the world, approximately 8.5 million hectares. The Tatshenshini-Alsek Park has been designated as a\n  <a href=\"http://whc.unesco.org/sites/72.htm\" target=\"_blank\">\n    World Heritage Site</a>\n  by UNESCO. The Alsek and Tatshenshini rivers are responsible for much of what’s special in the area. The great gap they’ve carved through the coastal mountains allows cool, moist ocean air into the cold interior. The quick change from ocean to interior environment, frequent floods, landslides and avalanches, a varied geology and great elevation changes have together created an exceptionally diverse range of habitat conditions.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Despite its remote location the ruggedly beautiful Tatshenshini-Alsek region is attracting an increasing number of recreationalists:\n  <a href=\"rafting-kayaking\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"legacy-link\">\n    kayakers and rafters</a>\n  are drawn to the two magnificent river systems;\n  <a href=\"hiking-biking\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"legacy-link\">\n    hikers</a>\n  and mountaineers confront a near-endless pristine wilderness that includes everything from alpine meadows to the jagged edges of the Alsek Ranges and Mt. Fairweather, the province’s highest peak at 4,633 metres; and\n  <a href=\"hiking-biking\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"legacy-link\">\n    mountain bikers</a>\n  can explore old mining roads and other interesting and challenging terrain. Interestingly, the Haines Highway provides an opportunity to see much of the same unusual plant and animal diversity that river users experience.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Established Date:</strong>\n  October 15, 1993\n  <br>\n  <strong>Park Size:</strong>\n  947,026 hectares\n  <br>\n</p>",

      "safetyInfo": "<h4>Stay Safe</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Visitors to Tatshenshini-Alsek Park should be aware that this is a rugged wilderness area; appropriate clothing, camping gear and sufficient supplies are a necessity. If planning to hike or mountain bike, it is important to remember that weather conditions in the summer are highly variable. Although a day may start with clear skies and sunshine, it can quickly change, and snow is possible any day of the year. High winds are frequent and there are often long spells of cold, wet weather.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Rafters must be aware that the remoteness of this park is an\n    <strong>essential</strong>\n    factor to consider in trip preparation and safety. The exception to the level of difficulty is Turnback Canyon on the Alsek River. This section of the river is\n    <strong>extremely hazardous at all water levels\n    </strong>and travel is\n    <strong>not recommended</strong>\n    for even the most skilled rafter/kayaker.\n    <strong>Portaging is recommended for all trips.\n    </strong>\n    <p>\n    </p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Special Notes\n  <br>\n</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Comprehensive archaeological studies of the Alsek and Tatshenshini River corridors are not yet complete. If you come across a site or artifact of cultural significance you are encouraged to report its location and what you saw to the BC Parks office in Atlin at (250) 651-7634. Please remember that it is an offence to damage or remove any natural or cultural resource from a Provincial Park.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Despite the great diversity of life found in the Tatshenshini, existence for its inhabitants can be a fragile one. Winters are long, the growing season is short and damaged vegetation rehabilitates slowly. This is one reason why\n    <strong>no motorized vehicles are allowed off the highway</strong>, except in the winter when snowmobiling is\n    <strong>\n      allowed within a specified area.</strong>\n    Visitors are asked to take special care to minimize impact on the landscape. Please pack out your litter and plan any camping or campfires so there is no evidence of your passage. This will ensure that future travelers will experience the same wilderness that you do.\n  </li>\n</ul>",

      "description": "<div>\n  <p>\n    The backcountry areas of Wells Gray Park offer hiking to suit a wide variety of abilities and interests, user-maintained wilderness camping, with opportunities for canoeing, fishing, exploring and wildlife viewing. Most trails are located within the southern third of the park – north of that, visitors must be adept at map-and-compass orienteering. All hikers, whether day-trip or overnight, should be completely self-sufficient, and have advised friends and family of proposed route and time of return. The Provincial Emergency Program created an excellent form,\n    <strong>Trip Plan for Outdoor Survival</strong>\n    – please use it! Forms can be picked up at the Information Centre or from the R.C.M.P.\n  </p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>\n      <a href=\"/explore/parkpgs/wells_gry/trail_report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"legacy-link\">\n        Wells Gray Trail Report [PDF]\n      </a>\n      (August 31, 2022)\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n  <h4>Green Mountain Canyonlands</h4>\n  <p>\n    This trail system is the only one in Wells Gray open to horse use, with guided rides available. Access points are the Flatiron and White Horse Bluffs trailheads, with circle hikes possible. Some excellent wilderness camping sites along the Clearwater River; note that everybody is restricted to camping in specific sites only. Trail maps are posted at all trailheads and junctions. The trail system is approximately 40 km total length.\n  </p>\n  <h4>Battle Mountain</h4>\n  <p>\n    This high elevation area can be hiked as a loop trail, approximately 30 km total length. Leaving your vehicle at the first parking area on the Battle Mountain road (2.5 km from the Wells Gray Park road) take the Battle Creek trail. The lower half of the trail is dry, but steep switchbacks with loose rock make hiking time slow. Approximately 11 km from trailhead to Fight Lake Meadows camping area, a small public-use cabin is located behind a cluster of trees – not bug-proof, but adequate shelter in bad weather.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    If used in the winter, skiers may have to dig to find it – be sure to clear all snow from the chimney before lighting the fire! Don’t confuse this very simple structure with the chalet at the base of 52 Ridge, owned by a company offering guided hiking and skiing trips through this area. Fight Lake provides a good base camp for exploring 52 Ridge, and the expansive Cariboo Meadows, noted for wild flower displays in July and early August. From Fight Meadows, follow the trail south to Philip Lake, returning to the Battle Mountain road via a steep trail along the Philip Creek drainage. Return to your vehicle by hiking 5 km down the road. This upper section is not suitable for anything less than a high-clearance 4-wheel-drive. Hikers must be prepared for mountain weather with white-out conditions. Carry insect repellent and water.\n  </p>\n  <h4>Pyramid Mountain and Pyramid Lakes</h4>\n  <p>\n    From a parking area near Pyramid Campground, a&nbsp;6.5 km trail&nbsp;leads to a campsite&nbsp;on the Murtle River. A side trail leads to Pyramid Lakes, noted for ice-fishing in winter months.&nbsp;The wilderness campsite is located&nbsp;just north of Pyramid Mountain. This campsite has&nbsp;no facilities but is located across the river from an impressive&nbsp;lava cliff and has a deep swimming hole in which to cool off.&nbsp;&nbsp;The main&nbsp;trail skirts the base of Pyramid Mountain, there is&nbsp;a side trail leading to the summit, providing panoramic views of the south end of Wells Gray Park. Pyramid Mountain is a Tuya, a volcano that erupted under a glacier approximately 11,000 years ago. Make sure to carry water as there is none available until the Murtle River at 6.5 km. This trail can be a hot spot for mosquitos so it is a good idea to carry insect repellent.\n  </p>\n  <h4>\n    Trophy Mountain</h4>\n  <p>\n    The most easily accessed of Wells Gray’s backcountry areas, with spectacular wild flower displays in July and August. Follow Roads 80, 10, and 201 from the Wells Gray Park Road, with a handout available at the Wells Gray Information Centre in Clearwater to guide your way. From the parking lot, a 1 km hike leads to the sub-alpine meadows, with an additional 1.5 km taking visitors to Sheila Lake. Hikers seeking panoramic views can continue on to Skyline Ridge (12 km round trip from the parking lot). Be prepared for sudden changes in weather, carry insect repellent and water, and watch for bear sign – the slopes of Trophy are important grizzly habitat. The alpine environment is so fragile and slow to recover from damage it is important to ensure that everyone stays on the trail, camp in the designated site only, light no open fires, carry out everything you bring in, and if you must bring your dog, keep it on a leash and on the trail at all times.\n  </p>\n</div>",

      "description": "<p>\n  The Stuart-Trembleur-Takla Lake boating system is located in north central British Columbia and comprises nearly 300 km of waterway. These long, narrow lakes are among the region’s most significant recreational features. The lakes offer great sports fishing opportunities for rainbow and lake trout, burbot, kokanee, and mountain whitefish. The chain is also part of the longest migration route of chinook and sockeye salmon in British Columbia. With more than 630 km of lakeshore to explore, few developed facilities, and sparse levels of use, this chain of lakes provides a remote wilderness experience. A series of small parks have been established along the system providing protected anchorages or attractive beaches. No facilities have been developed at these sites.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Stuart Lake is one of the largest natural lakes in the province at 90 km long with 270 km of shoreline. The community of Fort St. James is located on the southeast end. The main body of the lake is between 6 to 10 km wide and is road accessible at many locations. The northwestern arm of the lake is narrower, has limited road access, and more of a wilderness feel. This portion of the lake is very scenic with numerous bays, points, and islands. Wildlife viewing, boating, hunting, and angling are popular pursuits in the area.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Stuart Lake Marine Park consists of three lakeside sites protected as part of the Stuart-Trembleur-Takla Lakes boating system. Stuart Lake Park is also on the Stuart-Trembleur-Takla Lakes boating system. These sites provide no facilities, but may offer protected anchorages or sandy beaches.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The Tachie River connects Stuart Lake to Trembleur Lake. The 26 km of river can be a challenge to navigate with fast water and small rapids. Trembleur Lake is almost 50 km long. It has an irregular shoreline with sheltered bays and coves and a scenic wilderness setting. There is one marine park site on Trembleur Lake.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The Middle River flows from Takla Lake into Trembleur Lake.

      "natureAndCulture": "<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>History:</strong>\n    <p>\n      For many years prior to the arrival of European explorers, the Stuart-Trembleur-Takla lakes area was home to the Dakelh-ne people. In 1806, Simon Fraser brought the fur trade to this area with the establishment of the Stuart Lake Post for the North West Company.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The company merged with the Hudson’s Bay Company in 1821, and in 1822 they named the settlement Fort St. James. Fort St. James, once the economic capital of the colony of New Caledonia, saw its importance as a fur trading centre diminish in 1869 when gold was discovered 100 miles north in the Omineca Valley.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      With the miners came a new economic prosperity for the area that has largely been replaced by the forest industry today. Tourism is also growing, and hunting and fishing lodges can be found on all three lakes.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong>\n    <p>\n      Although settled by Europeans almost 200 years ago, the Dakelh-ne people had inhabited the area for years prior. To the fur traders, these people became known as the Carrier people, referring to the custom of widows who carried the ashes of cremated husbands with them until a traditional potlatch could be held.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The Carrier people traditionally led a semi-nomadic life, congregating along lakes and rivers in the warmer months to pick berries, hunt and tan hides, and catch and process the salmon that was an important staple of their diet. The winter was spent ice fishing and trapping in smaller family units.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Several Carrier groups reside in the Stuart-Trembleur-Takla lakes area including the Nak’azdli, Yekoochet’en, Takla, and Tl’azt’en. Traditional trails, culturally altered trees, and pictographs can be found throughout the area.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Conservation:</strong>\n    <p>\n      The three small sites of Stuart Lake Marine Park and Stuart Lake Park protect natural areas and contribute to the role of the Stuart-Trembleur-Takla lakes system as a backcountry boating destination area.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Wildlife:</strong>\n    <p>\n      Diversity of the terrain and types of vegetation support abundant wildlife populations. Moose and black bear are plentiful. Other more secretive species include mule and white-tail deer, wolf, and grizzly bear. Furbearers in the area include lynx, fox, beaver, marten, fisher, otter, and wolverine.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n</ul>",

      "natureAndCulture": "<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Conservation:</strong>\n      The Northern Rocky Mountains Park provides representation of the Eastern Muskwa Ranges, Muskwa Foothills and Muskwa Plateau ecosections. The park landscape consists of a series of northwest-southeast trending valley and ridges. Glaciation has resulted in broad U-shaped river valley bottoms, mountain cirques and morainal ridges. The mountains in the Muskwa Range have steep eastern faces with gentler grades on western aspects. Peak summit elevations range from Mount Mary Henry at 2641 m to Mount Sylvia at 2942 m. In comparison to the southern Rocky Mountains, the Muskwa Ranges are older and generally show evidence of more complex tectonic deformation that results in spectacular geological features.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      One of the notable features of the Northern Rocky Mountains Park is the diversity of water features. The area is accentuated by major rivers, clear, cold streams, waterfalls, rapids, small glaciers and lakes. The rivers include the Tetsa, Chischa, Tuchodi and Muskwa and the main creeks are the Gathto, Kluachesi, Dead Dog and Chlotapecta. All creeks and rivers in the Northern Rocky Mountains flow into the Muskwa. Kluachesi and Tetsa are examples of the larger lakes in the area, but the largest and most important water recreation feature in the Northern Rocky Mountains Park is the upper and lower Tuchodi Lakes.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The Boreal White and Black Spruce, Spruce Willow Birch and the Alpine Tundra biogeoclimatic zones are found in the Northern Rocky Mountains Park. Forests in the valley bottoms are dominated by white spruce and aspen, and are replaced by sub-alpine fir and white spruce at higher elevations. Alpine plant communities consist of dwarf willows, grasses, sedges, forbs and lichens. The park also has numerous wetlands and native grasslands. Old growth white spruce forests can be found along the major river valley bottoms.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Wildlife:</strong>\n    A diverse variety of wildlife inhabits this northeastern mountain landscape. The area provides high quality habitat for moose, elk, stone sheep and mountain goat. The abundance of prey supports predator species such as wolves and grizzly and black bears. Other important wildlife includes furbearers such as marten, fisher, weasels and wolverines. Information on small mammals, amphibians, birds, invertebrates and reptiles is relatively unknown. Lake trout, rainbow trout, bull trout, arctic grayling and lake whitefish are some of the important sport fish species in the Northern Rocky Mountains Park.\n  </li>\n</ul>",

      "natureAndCulture": "<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>History:</strong>\n    Foch-Gilttoyees was designated as a Class A provincial Park on May 20, 2004 following recommendations from the Kalum Land and Resource Management Plan. The protected area portion was designated a year later on March 22, 2005. Drum Lummon Mines and Paisley Point Mines established mineral claims north of Drumlummon Bay in the early 1920’s for extraction of copper, gold and silver. Some mineral claims still exist in this area (adjacent to the north side of the protected area) but are excluded from the park.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong>\n    Foch-Gilttoyees contains part of a historical First Nations travel route between the Douglas Channel and the Skeena River (the remainder of the route is in Gitnadoiks River Park).\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Conservation:</strong>\n    Foch Lagoon is one of the largest and most remote lagoons on the BC coast. It includes a highly productive and unique tidal narrows at its entranceway. Because of the heavy tide influence in the narrows the oceanic productivity in this area is very high compared to the rest of the Douglas Channel. The kelp beds that are found in this area support nurseries for a wide array of sea life.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Wildlife:</strong>\n    Foch-Gilttoyees protects a regionally significant estuary complex at the north end of the Gilttoyees Inlet. The Gilttoyees Creek and Peechugh Creek estuary is notable for its well-developed inter-tidal flats and relatively under-developed mud flats. Salt-water marsh and meadow communities dominate the inter-tidal flats. The estuary has very high wildlife values, particularly over-wintering habitat for the Blue-listed Trumpeter Swan, Barrow’s Goldeneye, Harlequin Duck, Surf Scoter, Long-tailed duck and Western Grebe.\n  </li>\n</ul>",

The area is accentuated by major rivers, clear, cold streams, waterfalls, rapids, small glaciers and lakes. The rivers include the Tetsa, Chischa, Tuchodi and Muskwa and the main creeks are the Gathto, Kluachesi, Dead Dog and Chlotapecta. All creeks and rivers in the Northern Rocky Mountains flow into the Muskwa. Kluachesi and Tetsa are examples of the larger lakes in the area, but the largest and most important water recreation feature in the Northern Rocky Mountains Protected Area is the upper and lower Tuchodi Lakes.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The Boreal White and Black Spruce, Spruce Willow Birch and the Alpine Tundra biogeoclimatic zones are found in the Northern Rocky Mountains Park. Forests in the valley bottoms are dominated by white spruce and aspen, and are replaced by sub-alpine fir and white spruce at higher elevations. Alpine plant communities consist of dwarf willows, grasses, sedges, forbs and lichens. The park also has numerous wetlands and native grasslands. Old-growth white spruce forests can be found along the major river valley bottoms.\n      </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <strong>Wildlife:</strong>\n      A diverse variety of wildlife inhabits this northeastern mountain landscape. The area provides high quality habitat for moose, elk, stone sheep and mountain goat. The abundance of prey supports predator species such as wolves and grizzly and black bears. Other important wildlife includes furbearers such as marten, fisher, weasels and wolverines. Information on small mammals, amphibians, birds, invertebrates and reptiles is relatively unknown. Lake trout, rainbow trout, bull trout, arctic grayling and lake whitefish are some of the important sport fish species in the Northern Rocky Mountains Park.\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n</div>",
