Albert Edward as seen from various locations in the Comox Valley creates a unique draw to hikers of all experience levels. Sitting approximately 16km from the Strathcona Park Paradise Meadows trailhead the peak can be hiked in one day by fit and fast hikers, but is generally done as part of a one- or two-night excursion. With well-marked trails and a small elevation gain from the Paradise Meadows trailhead to Circlet Lake, the approach to Mt. Albert Edward is accessible even for novice hikers. Beyond Circlet Lake the rough unmaintained route offers a taste of more challenging backcountry navigation, rugged terrain, and steep inclines. The route also offers more experienced hikers a scenic jumping-off point for more strenuous multi-day routes. Visitors attempting this route have the opportunity to see beautiful mountain and ocean vistas, delicate alpine wildflowers, and perhaps the endemic Vancouver Island white-tailed ptarmigan or Vancouver Island marmot. The ease of access perhaps lulls hikers into complacency. Combine these relaxed attitudes with some of the serious hazards particular to the Albert Edward route, it is no surprise that\n  <strong>this is the second busiest hike for Search and Rescue on Vancouver Island</strong>. Please read the information below to help yourself properly prepare for this incredible hike.</p>\n<h2>Access</h2>\n<p>Mount Albert Edward is accessed through the Strathcona Provincial Park Paradise Meadows trailhead, located adjacent to Mt. Washington’s Raven Lodge.\n</p>\n<p>\n  From either Courtenay or Campbell River, follow the signs on Highway 19 leading to Mt. Washington ski area.&nbsp; 2km after the hairpin corner adjacent to the first chairlift, turn left onto Nordic drive.&nbsp; Follow Nordic Drive until you see the large stone Paradise Meadows, Strathcona Park portal sign where parking is available.&nbsp; Conveniently located next to the parking lot is the small Strathcona Park Wilderness Centre. The wheelchair accessible park information building is operated between May and October by volunteers of the non-profit Strathcona Wilderness Institute.\n</p>\n<h2>Camping</h2>\nCamping is available on this route in one of 4 designated campsites (one being a backcountry group site).&nbsp; Random camping is not allowed in the area of Strathcona Provincial Park between the Paradise Meadows trailhead and the summit of Mt. Albert Edwards due to high visitation numbers and sensitivity of the ecosystems.\n<br>\nCamping fees are $10 per adult (age 16 and older) per night; and $5 per child (age 6-15) per night.&nbsp; Further information can be found at the\n<a href=\"/explore/parkpgs/strath/\" class=\"legacy-link\">Strathcona Provincial Park webpage.</a>&nbsp; Click the&nbsp; link for “Facilities Available at this Park” and scroll down to find the heading “Walk-In/Backcountry Wilderness Camping”.&nbsp; The Mt. Albert Edward trail is located in the Forbidden Plateau Area of the park (Note as of Jan. 2021 the new group site at Croteau Lake does not show on the trail map).<p></p>\n<h2>Route Description</h2>\n<h4>\n  Paradise Meadows Trailhead to Circlet Lake</h4>\n<p>\n  The most direct route – past Lake Helen Mackenzie, the ranger cabin, onward to Circlet Lake and the climb up Mount Albert Edward – is approximately 16km one way, making it a 32km return trip.&nbsp; The exact route taken between the Paradise Meadows trailhead and Circlet Lake can be varied.\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"/explore/parkpgs/strath/forbid.html\" class=\"legacy-link\">Paradise Meadows trailhead to Circlet Lake trail network descriptions</a>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>From the Paradise Meadows trailhead to the Circlet Lake junction is anywhere between approximately 9.5 and 12km depending on the chosen route.&nbsp; The net change in elevation between the two locations is approximately 120m.</p>\n<h4>\n  Beyond Circlet Lake\n</h4>\n<br>\n<a href=\"images/circlet-lake-to-albert-edward-summit.jpg\" class=\"legacy-link\">\n  <img src=\"images/circlet-lake-to-albert-edward-summit.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1: Route from Circlet Lake to summit of Albert Edward showing important locations.\" title=\"Figure 1: Route from Circlet Lake to summit of Albert Edward showing important locations.\" class=\"legacy-image\">\n</a>\n<a href=\"images/albert-edward-elevation-profile.jpg\" class=\"legacy-link\">\n  <img src=\"images/albert-edward-elevation-profile.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2: Elevation Profile of Albert Edward hike.

Note the change in slope beyond Circlet Lake.\" class=\"legacy-image\">\n</a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>After the Circlet Lake/Mount Albert Edward junction, the trail becomes an unmaintained route, and is much rougher and steeper (Fig. 2).&nbsp; Approximately 2 km after this junction the trail climbs into the alpine, where the landscape distinctly transitions from a well vegetated slope to a bare rocky ridge.&nbsp; This means that there is no visible trail tread to assist in navigation.&nbsp; From here the route follows the alpine ridge up to the peak of Mount Albert Edward, and successful completion of the hike is completely dependent on the navigational ability of the individual hiker.&nbsp; This alpine ridge section of the hike is approximately 4km (1hr hiking) each way.&nbsp; While this is relatively simple to navigate if weather is clear, it becomes extremely difficult if not impossible as visibility decreases (Fig. 3)</p>\n<a href=\"images/albert-edward-foggy-conditions.jpg\" class=\"legacy-link\">\n  <img src=\"images/albert-edward-foggy-conditions.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3: Example of foggy conditions common in the alpine sections of the Mt. Albert Edward hike.\" title=\"Figure 3: Example of foggy conditions common in the alpine sections of the Mt. Albert Edward hike.\" class=\"legacy-image\">\n</a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<h4>Waymaking Posts</h4>\n<p>Every year multiple people get lost along this trail and must call Search and Rescue, spend an uncomfortable night out in the elements, or both. The majority of these lost person scenarios are due to hikers missing one critical turn on the trail – dropping off the bare rock alpine ridge back to the visible trail tread that leads eventually to Circlet Lake. See the “Important Locations” table in the next section for GPS coordinates for these locations. It is important for hikers to find this trail when descending, because there are dangerous cliff bands on the sides of the ridge in almost every other location.</p>\n<p>Problems arise here because historically there have been very minimal visual clues to indicate to hikers walking along this featureless ridge where the turnoff is. Combined with a lack of observation from hikers, or a drastic decrease in visibility from clouds or fog, the critical turn is easy to miss.</p>\n<p>In 2020, a series of eight-foot-tall aluminum posts were installed with reflective signs and stickers pointing the way back to Circlet Lake (Fig. 4). It is important for all hikers to take note of these posts as they are ascending and return to this point as they are descending. Failure to navigate back to these posts will most likely result in becoming lost or stuck in dangerous terrain.</p>\n<h4>Important Waymaking Locations (waypoints are approximate)</h4>\n<br>\n<a href=\"images/albert-edward-waymaking-post.jpg\" class=\"legacy-link\">\n  <img src=\"images/albert-edward-waymaking-post.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 4: Waymarking posts to lead hikers off the ridge at the critical trail junction that is the only safe way back to Circlet Lake.\" title=\"Figure 4: Waymarking posts to lead hikers off the ridge at the critical trail junction that is the only safe way back to Circlet Lake.\" class=\"legacy-image\">\n</a>\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>\n          <strong>Location</strong>\n        </p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\n          <strong>UTM Coordinates (Zone 10U)</strong>\n        </p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\n          <strong>Degrees Minutes Seconds</strong>\n        </p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Circlet Lake Campground</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>0328445<strong></strong>\n          <br>\n          5507703</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>49°41’50.604”<br>\n          -125°22’44.364”</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Moat Lake trail/Albert Edward route junction</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>0328588<br>\n          5507342</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>49°41’39.0732”<br>\n          -125°22’36.66”</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>End of trail tread, start of bare rock route</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>0327259<br>\n          5506880</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>49°41’22.7616”<br>\n          -125°23’42.209”</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Official Cairn</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>0327059<br>\n          5506860</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>49°41’21.9084”<br>\n          -125°23’52.148”</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Albert Edward route/Mt.

Albert Edward.&nbsp; This takes the average hiker approximately 1 hour each way (not including breaks), which is enough time for conditions to change drastically.</li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Few Landmarks</strong>: The approach ridge is a long, linear feature with very little in the way of landmarks.&nbsp; As visibility decreases, the ability to navigate by sight alone quickly becomes difficult or impossible.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Hazardous Terrain</strong>: There is only one way to return to Circlet Lake and the main trail system.&nbsp; The summit approach ridge drops off on both sides to significant cliff bands with no possible route down.&nbsp; The safe route down is now marked on the ridge with aluminum posts (Fig.4).</li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>No Service:</strong>\n    Cell phone service may be unreliable depending on weather and service provider.</li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>No Shelter</strong>: There are very few opportunities to find shelter (ie. Trees, structures, etc.) in the alpine section of this hike.&nbsp; Risk of exposure in poor weather is high.</li>\n</ul>",

Suggested hiking time: 7 hours.   Elevation change: 350 metres. The trail starts at the west end   of Great Central Lake and follows the old railway grade up the   Drinkwater Valley to near the base of Della Falls. Access to   this trail is by boat or canoe from the eastern end of Great   Central Lake, northwest of Port Alberni. Travel time by powerboat   is about 45 minutes, or one day if canoeing. Paddlers should   be aware that this area is subject to high winds and should   exercise caution when crossing the lake. Access to the trailhead   via float plane is also an option. The notable features of this   hike include Della Falls, which at 440 metres is one of the   10 highest waterfalls in the world. Also of interest are historic   sites from the early days of logging and mining. This trail   also provides access to Love Lake and Della Lake. Note: handrails   are removed for the winter season on the narrow bridge over   the Drinkwater River (12.5 km from the trailhead).<br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Love Lake:</strong>\n  Length 4 km. Suggested hiking time: 2 hours.   Elevation change: 830 metres. The trail starts from the Della   Falls Trail at the 15 km mark and ascends to Love Lake. Good   observation points of Della Falls are offered en route.<br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Gold Lake</strong>: Length 5 km. Suggested hiking time: 2.5 hours. Elevation change is minimal. NOTE: As of 2016 the trailhead is no longer accessible by vehicle. The Bridge at Gisle Creek has been removed. If the water is low enough to cross by foot, the road to the trailhead (approximately 8km) can still be hiked.<br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Comox Glacier:</strong>\n  Comox Lake logging road and glacier trail access - During the year, if there are logging operations occurring, this area, TimberWest restricts access with a gate and security personnel.&nbsp;For up to date information please contact TimberWest or view their website:\n  <a href=\"http://www.timberwest.com/community/access/recreational-access.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.timberwest.com/community/access/recreational-access.aspx</a>\n  <br>\n  Length 9 km. Suggested   hiking time: 5 hours to ridge. Elevation change: 1,600 metres.   Follow Comox Lake logging road to Cruickshank Canyon, continuing   along the spur toward Comox Creek until the road ends where   the bridge has been removed. Park here and follow the road on   foot for 2-3 km. A sign on the right hand side of the road marks   the start of the trail. The trail climbs for approximately 1,000   metres before you reach the park boundary, then continues to   climb to the ridge, where there are a number of camping locations.   From the ridge, the glacier is approximately a one day return   trip. Water is scarce; be sure to bring all that you require.<br>\n  <br>This steep trail and alpine route is not maintained and is suitable   only for advanced hikers and mountaineers. Road access to this   trail follows active logging roads; these may be closed to the   public during work hours. The chance of encountering loaded   logging trucks while traveling these roads is highly likely.   Logging trucks have the right of way at all times. Drivers should   use caution and yield to logging trucks; use pullouts whenever   possible. Backcountry road maps are also a good idea.<br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Tennent Lake-Mount Myra:</strong>\n  Length 7 km. Suggested hiking time:   5 hours. Elevation change: 1,500 metres. This trail starts just   past the Boliden-Westmin mine at Strathcona-Westmin Park and   follows a gravel road for 900 metres. The trail then leaves   the road beside the pump house and follows a very steep, older   roadbed to Tennent Lake. A route exists from Tennent Lake to   Mount Myra.\n</blockquote>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"nature_walks\" href=\"/\"></a>Nature Walks and Short Trails</h2>\n<blockquote>\n  <strong>Lady Falls:</strong>\n  Length 900 metres. Suggested time: 20 minutes.   This trail starts at Highway 28 and follows through old-growth   forest of cedar, Douglas fir and hemlock. A viewing platform   offers great views of Lady Falls.<br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Elk River Viewpoint:</strong>\n  Length 400 metres. Suggested time:   10 minutes. This trail starts at Highway 28 and follows along   the BC Hydro power line. A viewing platform provides views across   the Elk River and toward Roosevelt elk habitat. Interpretive   signs at the trailhead and viewing platform educate visitors   about Strathcona’s Roosevelt Elk.<br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Lupin Falls:</strong>\n  Length 800 metres. Suggested time: 20 minutes.   The trail to Lupin Falls starts from the Buttle Lake/Westmin   Mines Road. This is a short, loop trail through a cool old-growth   forest featuring unique saprophytes that include Indian Pipe,   Candystick and Pine Drops. Great views of Lupin Falls can be   had from a viewing area, complete with a park bench.<br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Auger Point:</strong>\n  This trail starts off at the Buttle Lake/Westmin   Mines Road. This five-minute loop leads through an old-growth   Douglas fir forest that was devastated by forest fire in the   mid-1980s. This trail provides views of nature as it reclaims   and “greens up” the burnt-over landscape.<br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Karst Creek:</strong>\n  Length 2 km. Suggested time: 45 minutes. This   trail starts off at the Buttle Lake/Westmin Mines Road and passes   by a limestone area that includes sinkholes, disappearing streams   and a waterfall.<br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Wild Ginger:</strong>\n  This 15-minute loop trail through old-growth   forest begins across from the Ralph River campground. Large   patches of wild ginger and a wide range of forest flowers abound   along this trail.<br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Shepherd Creek:</strong>\n  Length 1.5 km. Suggested time: 45 minutes. This   loop trail begins across from the Ralph River campground and   travels through a mix of open forest and marshy areas with minimal   elevation change.<br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Lower Myra Falls:</strong>\n  Length 1 km. Suggested walking time: 15   minutes. The trail starts near the south end of Buttle Lake   before the Nyrstar-Westmin mine site. This trail has one steep   section. There are views of several beautiful cascades from   a viewing platform at Myra Falls, as well as access to several   creek side areas.\n  <strong>Please exercise caution when visiting the   falls.</strong>\n</blockquote>",

They   range from well-developed, hard surface trails such as the Yellowhead   Mountain Trail to pure wilderness routes like the Moose River.   The following will give an overview of each trail or route but   it is recommended that hikers check current conditions/hazards   at the\n  <a href=\"visinfo\" class=\"legacy-link\">Visitor Centre</a>\n  prior to starting their hike.   All of these trails travel through bear country. Any trail updates   will be posted under the park advisories for Mount Robson.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Yellowhead   Mountain Trail</strong>: Named after Pierre Bostonais (Tete Jaune),   an Iroquois guide who worked for the North West and Hudson’s   Bay fur trading companies in the early 1800s, Yellowhead Mountain   remains, to this day, the guardian of the Yellowhead Pass. The   pass not only marks the border between Alberta and British Columbia   but is the subtle spine that separates the Pacific and Arctic   watersheds.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Located   52.8 km east of the Mount Robson Park Visitor Centre, the Yellowhead   Mountain Trailhead can be accessed by turning north at Whitney   lake. A one kilometre drive will take you to a small parking   lot located adjacent to the railway tracks. This trail will   gain 800 metres in elevation in a distance of 8.5 km so it is   only recommended for persons that are in reasonably good condition.   At the 2 km point a viewpoint will provide excellent views of   the surrounding mountains and lakes. After hiking an additional   6.5 km an sub alpine meadow system will be reached.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Although   quite steep in places, the trail will reward you with wonderful   views. As you gain elevation, note how the vegetation communities   change. From valley bottom Pine, Fir and Aspen to sub alpine   Fir and Black Spruce. There are no facilities or campsites on   this trail, and it is recommended for day hikes only. Take plenty   of water and enjoy this pleasant 3 - 5 hour return trip.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <img src=\"mtrob13.jpg\" alt=\"photo of one of many kinds of flowers found along Mount Fitzwilliam Trail\" class=\"legacy-image\">\n  <strong>Mount   Fitzwilliam Trail</strong>: In 1863, while camped on the shores of   Yellowhead Lake, Walter Butler Cheadle and William Wentworth   Fitzwilliam otherwise known as Viscount Milton, gazed upon the   “cone-like and terraced”   mountain to the south and decided to   name it Mount Fitzwilliam, after Milton's title, Viscount Milton   of Fitzwilliam.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A royal name for one of the most impressive   and imposing peaks in the Rocky Mountains.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The Mount   Fitzwilliam trailhead and parking lot are located 54 km east   of the Mount Robson Park Visitor Centre on Highway 16. Information   shelter, parking and pit toilets are located on the shores of   Yellowhead Lake. From there, cross to the south side of the   highway and travel west along the pipeline right of way for   1.2 km.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Please register   at the small info shelter located here prior to leaving the   pipeline on the trail proper.\n</p>\n<p>\n  There are   numerous switchbacks for the first two kilometres. At approximately   3.2 km the trail flattens somewhat. The first campsite is located   7.2 km up the trail along Rockingham Creek. A beautiful treed   site with views of Mount Fitzwilliam. At this point one has   gained 600 metres in elevation. Six tent pads, pit toilet and   bear pole are located here.\n</p>\n<p>\n  After crossing   the bridge over Rockingham Creek, the trail heads east around   the base of Mount Fitzwilliam. The   trail up to the main campsite   on Rockingham Creek is a good hard surface trail while the trail   beyond that point is rough, not very well defined and can be   very wet early in the season and during rainy periods.\n</p>\n<p>\n  After going   through open meadows, skirting the bottom of a rock slide the   trail will come to a headwall at kilometre 11. Follow the trail   markers up the left side of the gully. Caution should be used   in this area. Slippery rocks and rockfall can at times be a   hazard. An additional 2.5 km will take one to the wilderness   campsite located at the north end of the first alpine lake.   A bear pole, open pit toilet and three tent pads can be found   here. There are a number of excellent day hikes available from   this point.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <img src=\"mtrob31.jpg\" alt=\"photo of Slide Lakes\" class=\"legacy-image\">\n  <strong>Moose River Route</strong>: The Moose River Route is just that, a route,   not specifically a trail. This is not to imply that there is     no visible trail but that there are a number of sections that     cross braided gravel flats, or avoid marsh areas and may not<br>\n  be discernible.\n</p>\n<p>\n  This 5-7 day route is recommended for experienced backpackers only.   Starting from the trail head on the north side of the CNR (Canadian   National Railway) tracks by the Moose River, Highway   16 junction, the trail trends generally north following Resplendent   Creek and the Moose River. A loop is possible on this route.   At the 49 KM mark, the route will enter into Jasper National   Park at Moose Pass. This point also marks the continental divide.   The route then descends Calumet Creek, to the Smokey River,   then back onto the Pacific side of the Continental Divide at   Berg Lake. From the Highway 16 trailhead to the Berg Lake Campground   is a distance of 66 km.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A number   of wilderness campsites are located along the route. From the   first one only 4.2 km from the trailhead to Berg Lake itself,   several campsites can be found. Resplendent Creek camp, 15.3   km, Trio Mountain camp, 26 km, Steppe Creek camp, 38 km, Slide   Lake Camp, 43 km, Calumet Creek Camp (Jasper), 52 km, Adolphus   Camp (Jasper), 61.5 km and the Berg Lake Camp at 66 km. Several   campgrounds are located as well on the remainder of the Berg   Lake Trail should one wish to continue down the Robson River   / Berg Lake Trail back to Highway 16.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Development   on the Moose River Route is limited to primitive backcountry   sites with open toilet bar, bear pole and rustic fire circle.   The route is not regularly patrolled by ranger staff so hikers   must be completely self-contained and able to contend with any   eventuality one may encounter in a wilderness environment.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Depending   on weather and melt off, the numerous unbridged river crossings   can present a legitimate hazard. Late summer into early fall   seem to offer the most reliable water levels, however creek   and river levels can rise quickly after periods of heavy rain.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The entire   route and in particular the section from just south of Steppe   Creek to the Smokey River / Calumet Creek confluence, including   Moose Pass, is &nbsp; excellent bear country. Some of the best   Grizzly Bear habitat in the park exists in these areas. Experience   in\n  <a href=\"/plan-your-trip/visit-responsibly/wildlife-safety\">bear avoidance</a>,   safe travel techniques and food storage and preparation are   an absolute must for a safe experience.\n  <img src=\"mtrob12.jpg\" alt=\"photo of hikers on the Moose River Route\" class=\"legacy-image\">\n  Wildlife   along the route are typical of the Central Rocky Mountain Ecosystem,   Grizzly and Black Bear, Wolf, Moose, Caribou, Mountain Goat,   Whitetail and Mule Deer. A host of smaller animals include Wolverine,   Coyote, Marmot and Pika. There have been over 182 species of   birds documented in Mount Robson Park and the Moose River provides   excellent habitat for many of these species.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A wildfire   in 1998 in the Colonel Creek / Upright Creek area created a   mosaic of habitats that will draw a wide variety of large and   small animals in future years. In this area of the park, natural   processes are encouraged to run their course. This would include,   under appropriate circumstances, wildfire, windthrow as well   as forest health issues. Excellent opportunities exist to observe   natural succession after a large wildfire event.\n</p>\n<p>\n  There is   a registration shelter at the Highway 16 trailhead and all parties   camping in Jasper National Park will need a National Parks backcountry   permit. Hikers camping on any portion of the\n  <a href=\"/mt-robson-park/berg-lake-trail/\" class=\"legacy-link\">Berg   Lake Trail</a>\n  will need to register and pay overnight fees   at the\n  <a href=\"visinfo\" class=\"legacy-link\">Visitor Centre</a>\n  prior   to starting their trip. Up-to-date trail conditions can be obtained   at the Visitor Centre as well.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The Moose   River Route should only be attempted by experienced backpackers,   self-contained and prepared to handle river crossings, wet marsh   areas and uncertain mountain weather conditions.\n</p>",

      "content": "<a name=\"History\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"History\" href=\"/\"></a>History</h2>\n<p>\n  Established   by a special act of the British Columbia legislature in 1913, Mount   Robson Provincial Park is the second oldest park in the Province   of British Columbia's park system. It was designated as a world   heritage site, part of the Rocky Mountains World Heritage Site,   in 1990 by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural   Organization (UNESCO).\n  <br>\n  <br>Mount Robson   has a colorful early history of trade and transportation. From the   early 1800s with trappers, explorers, hunters, prospectors and ordinary   folks seeking the end of the rainbow, to the present day. Transportation   is still important through the park with a national highway (Highway   16), a national railway, a national fiber optics system and a major   pipeline that connect the prairies to the Pacific Ocean. Now as   then, all transportation corridors are confined to a narrow valley   bottom strip keeping the vast majority of the park as wilderness.\n  <br>\n  <br>Many locations   in the park recognize the role played by early explorers. Magnificent   Overland Falls, at the parks western entrance, honours the journey   undertaken in 1862 by 115 men and one woman, through the Yellowhead   Pass.\n  <br>\n</p>\n<a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\">Cultural Heritage</a>\n</h2>\n<p>\n  The Texqakallt   Nation, the area's earliest known inhabitants of the upper Fraser   area, called Mount Robson “Yuh-hai-has-kun” or “The Mountain of   the Spiral Road”. This referred to the layered appearance of the   huge mountain. Although not always given credit, Indigenous peoples   played a major role in the early exploration and trading in the   Yellowhead Pass - Tete Jaune area. They guided and provided game   to those who may have otherwise floundered.\n  <br>\n</p>\n<a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>Conservation</h2>\n<p>\n  <a href=\"../../../conserve/occ_paper/mtrobson.html\" class=\"legacy-link\">Occupational Paper #6 - Mount Robson Provincial Park Ecosystem  Management Plan</a>\n  <br>\n  <br>Mount Robson   Park provides full representation of the North Continental Ranges’   landscape. The park protects a complex mountain ecosystem represented   by four biogeoclimatic zones. From Interior Cedar Hemlock (ICH)   in the valley bottoms, the vegetation communities change as the   elevation increases. Sub-boreal Spruce (SBS), Englemann Spruce-subalpine   Fir (ESSF) and finally up slope to the Alpine Tundra (AT) zone.\n  <br>\n  <br>As these vegetation   communities change, so do the birds and animals. The diversity of   species is very much a product of elevation change. 182 species   of birds have been recorded in the park. Predator/prey relationships   are maintained within the 80% of the park-zoned wilderness. Vast   areas and intact watersheds carry a wilderness conservation zoning   label where all human use is unsupported by facility or trail development.   In fact, our most important “customers” in these large wilderness   areas are the wide variety of flora and fauna that depend on an   undisturbed, intact wilderness.<br>\n  <br>In addition   to protecting the largest peak in the entire Canadian Rockies, Mount   Robson at 12,972 feet / 3,954 m., the park also protects the imposing   Ramparts formation that forms a portion of our border with Jasper   National Park. Beautiful, expansive alpine areas, clear rivers,   lakes and highly valued wetland habitat is also protected. While   big mountains and imposing rock formations inspire and awe us, the   main feature of the park, at least from a conservation perspective,   is the headwaters of the Fraser River. Protected for all time within   Mount Robson Park are the headwaters of one of the world's great   rivers. Coming into the province of British Columbia from Alberta,   one crosses over a small, crystal clear creek. It's almost beyond   belief that this is the same river that empties into the Pacific   Ocean, over 1,200 kilometres away in Vancouver. The very source   of the great river lies in the south east corner of the park in   Fraser Pass. Imagine dipping your cup and drinking the water from   the very of start of one of the great rivers on this planet. Future   generations will no doubt praise the wisdom of protecting over 100   kilometres of the Fraser River's headwaters within Mount Robson   Park.\n  <br>\n  <br>Recent boundary   additions on the west end of the park, the result of the Robson   Valley Land, Resource Management Plan, will add important Interior   Cedar Hemlock variants. These additions also help in making the   previous straight line boundary more logical from a management and   ecological perspective.\n  <br>\n  <br>In order to   maintain viable levels of species and genetic diversity, it is critically   important to consider how the land is managed on a larger scale.   Working with our neighbors, be it the National Parks or the various   forest companies, remains a high priority to ensure Mount Robson   Park does not become an isolated biological “island”.\n</p>\n<a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>Wildlife</h2>\n<p>\n  To date, 42   species of mammals, four amphibians, one reptile and 182 species   of birds have been recorded in the park. These species are typical   of the moist, western slope of the Rocky Mountains. From the valley   bottom-loving Moose to the Mountain Goats and Golden eagles of the   Alpine Tundra Zone, all four biogeoclimactic zones within the park   provide habitat for varied species that favor the unique characteristics   found in each zone. This is not to say that species like Grizzly   bear or Mule Deer find suitable habitats in only one zone, but generally   certain zones or elevations attract specific species.<br>\n  <br>Excellent opportunities   for wildlife viewing are available within the park. On one drive   through the highway corridor in late May, park staff have observed   Mule Deer, Whitetail Deer, Moose, Elk, Wolf, Coyote, Black Bear,   Grizzly Bear and a large variety of waterfowl.<br>\n  <br>In the spring,   cow Elk become extremely protective of their new calves. Moose and   deer will also actively defend their young but the Elk seem most   prone to short tempers when confronted with anything they perceive   as a threat to their young. In the fall of the year it's the males   of these species that can become aggressive. The “mating or rutting”   season in September and October can make even the most seemingly   docile Elk, Moose or Deer aggressive. Although they are beautiful   to look at, keep clear of all wildlife and give them the space they   need to ensure their safety and yours.\n  <br>\n  <br>Binoculars are   a great aid to the traveler in Mount Robson Park. Mountain slopes,   slide paths and cliffs can be safely examined from the highway corridor.   Mountain Goats and Grizzly bears can often be spotted while other   travelers miss the show.\n  <br>\n  <br>A long tradition   in Mount Robson Park, the “Bird Blitz” takes place in June each   year. Bird enthusiasts from far and wide come to enjoy the beautiful   spring scenery as well as the opportunity to observe and count the   parks incredible bird population.\n  <br>\n  <br>A number of   the valleys in the park have no routes or trails and extremely low   levels of human use. This is in keeping with our belief that “wilderness”   means wild and the Grizzly Bears, Caribou, Wolverines and other   wilderness-loving species seem quite happy to keep it that way.\n</p>",

Assiniboine in  honour of the Assiniboine people when he visited the area during  the summer of 1899. Assiniboine means “stone boiler” a  name that comes from the Indian practice of putting hot rocks  into animal paunches or holes filled with water in order to cook  food.<br>\n  <br>Mt. Assiniboine  is the seventh tallest mountain in the Canadian Rockies and its  massive covers eighty square kilometres. Because  of its classic triangular shape and size it was considered a  great prize among early mountaineers. After a number of  legendary attempts,  Mt. Assiniboine was first ascended by James Outram and Swiss  guides Christian Hasler and Christian Bohren in late summer  of 1901.\n  <br>\n  <br>Upon the urging of the Alpine Club of Canada, British Columbia  set aside 5,120  hectares of the area on February 6, 1922 as Mount  Assiniboine Provincial Park, the seventh in a fledgling park  system. In 1973, the park area was increased sevenfold  to its present size  of 39,050 hectares<br>\n</p>\n<a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>Cultural Heritage</h2>\n<p>\n  This area  was well known to the indigenous peoples of the foothill and  mountain country. Occasionally interrupted by wars, there was  much trading between the tribes from the different sides of the  Rockies. The Peigans, the Assiniboines, the Blackfoot and the  Kootenai travelled the routes over many mountain passes through  the Rockies.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  Mount Assiniboine  Provincial Park lies within the traditional territory of the  Ktunaxa or Kootenai First Nations people.\n</p>\n<a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>Conservation</h2>\n<p>\n  Boreal forests  of spruce, intermixed with stands of alpine fir and lodgepole  pine, cover the lower elevations. In more open areas,  scattered patches of false azalea, buffalo berries, twin berries,  white rhododendrons and, occasionally, red elder may be found.  Between the elevations of 2,100 and 2,400 metres, open stands of  alpine larch occur alongside alpine fir and Engelmann spruce, with  a ground cover of red and white heather and grouse berries. Dense  thickets of various species of low-growing willows associated with  bog birch can be found along mountain streams and in boggy areas.<br>\n  <br>Large areas  of rocky slopes and ridges are covered by stonecrop, white flowering  avens, moss campion, cinquefoil, arctic willows  and several species of saxifrage. Alpine meadows blaze with colour  thanks to an abundance of western anemones, alpine arnica, columbine,  Indian paintbrush, spring beauty, alpine fleabane, mountain daisies,  and hundreds of other species of wildflowers during the midsummer  blossoming period.\n  <br>\n  <br>Do not pick  wildflowers as flowers contain the seed pods necessary for the  proliferation of wildflowers. It is an offence under  the Park Act and Regulations to destroy wildflowers.\n</p>\n<a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>Wildlife</h2>\n<p>\n  Wildlife species  such as elk, black and grizzly bears, mule deer, moose, mountain  goats and bighorn sheep inhabit the park. The chattering of Columbian  and mantled ground squirrels and chipmunks or the call of the  hoary marmot and pika are often heard. Wolverine, badger, wolf,  marten and coyote also inhabit the park but are seldom seen.  Ninety-three species of birds have been sighted in the park,  with the most common being northern harrier, grey jay, Clark's  nutcracker, white-tailed ptarmigan, pine grosbeak, rosy finch,  pine siskin, boreal chickadee, chipping sparrow and white-crowned  sparrow.\n</p>",

      "content": "<h2>\n  <a name=\"skiing\" href=\"/\"></a>Skiing</h2>\nAn increasing  number of cross-country skiers are visiting the park during winter.  Some special precautions are necessary with regards to access  and to proper equipment. The Naiset Cabins require a reservation  from December 1 to May 31. Please contact\n<a href=\"http://www.assiniboinelodge.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mount  Assiniboine Lodge</a>\nfor details.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Access</strong>:  Assiniboine Pass is the most popular route into the park. Use  the trailhead facilities in Peter Lougheed Provincial  Park,  Alberta, from Mount Shark along the Karst Trail to Watridge Lake.  From there, follow the trail around the northeast shore to the  Bryant Creek trailhead in Banff National Park. Follow the Bryant  Creek Trail over Assiniboine Pass. When skiing this route in  reverse, caution must be taken not to miss the Bryant Creek/Watridge  Lake  connection. The route is safe from\n<a href=\"#avalanche\">avalanches</a>\nas  long as the basic route-finding techniques are used. In normal  years,  conditions  for ski-touring are generally good from December 15 to April  30.\n<br>\n<br>An access  route leads from the Sunshine Ski area in Banff National Park  as previously outlined.\n<strong>This route is very difficult  and demanding. It should not be attempted by inexperienced or  improperly equipped  skiers.</strong>\nSkiers should register at any Banff Park Information  Centre or warden office and read the daily avalanche hazard  bulletins posted. The trip should only be attempted under  good winter travelling  conditions. Citadel Pass area is particularly avalanche-prone.<br>\n<br>Skiers often  get lost in the Valley of the Rocks. They try to follow the lay  of the land, which leads them into extremely  undulating  terrain. The best route to follow is: from the bottom of  Citadel Pass, traverse around the toe of a large avalanche  fan on the  south  side of the pass, then climb up along the southern edge  of the slide to a rock outcropping and traverse southerly to  another  outcropping. Stay on the uphill side, traverse at a steady  uphill grade staying  just inside the trees for approximately 4 km, then angle  into the centre of the valley and follow the natural clearings  to  Og Lake.\n<strong>Beware of a large avalanche slope that crosses  the valley just before Og Lake. Stay well up on the opposite  (west)  slope</strong>.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Equipment</strong>:  If you plan to ski into or out of the park, either metal-edged “Telemark-type” Nordic  skis or alpine touring equipment are recommended. Warm, durable  boots and climbing skins are also recommended. Light cross-country  skis are not suitable. Visitors must be prepared to camp out  overnight since snow conditions may make it impossible to complete  the trip  in one day. Winter travellers should also carry avalanche safety  equipment and know how to use it.\n<br>\n<br>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"avalanche\" href=\"/\"></a>Avalanche Safety</h2>\nWinter visitors  to Mount Assiniboine Provincial Park must stay alert to the possible  threat from avalanches.  When an avalanche  victim is caught in the backcountry, his chance for survival  depends on his efforts to keep above the flowing snow  and also on what  his fellow companions can do to rescue him. The probability  of survival decreases rapidly after 30 minutes.<strong>\n  It  is therefore essential that touring parties be equipped  for self-rescue.</strong>\nEach member of the party must  carry an avalanche beacon, a sectional probe and a collapsible  shovel. Do not rely on skis for digging: avalanche debris  is difficult to dig, even with a shovel. Attachments  for converting a pair of skis into an emergency toboggan  are also useful. Do not let wearing an avalanche beacon  give you a false sense of security. Note that one-third  of avalanche victims die.<br>\n<br>There are three   basic safety rules:\n<br>\n<ol>\n  <li>Observe the principles of safe route selection.</li>\n  <li>If danger areas must be traversed, they should be crossed one person at a time.  Obviously, if all of the members of a party are caught in  the same avalanche,  any hope of rescue is drastically reduced.</li>\n  <li>If a victim is buried in an avalanche, the rest of the party should search  immediately unless more help is only minutes away. If the touring party is  large, a messenger can be spared while the search proceeds. The history of  avalanche accidents has far too many tragic instances of survivors leaving the scene  in a panic to seek help when a few minutes of organized search would have  uncovered the victim.</li>\n</ol>\n<p></p>",

Distance travelled is approximately 10   km, and for experienced hikers under good conditions, the travel   time is estimated at 2-3 hours. From this point, one trail follows   Surprise Creek via Rock Lake to Ferro Pass (a distance of about   11 km and an estimated travel time of 2-3 hours); the Mitchell   Meadows campground is about 1.5 km from Ferro Pass and the   Magog Lake Campground is about 5-6 km farther along. Another trail   continues along the Simpson River through Golden Valley and   the Valley of the Rocks and along Og Creek to Magog Lake (distance   travelled is 32 km, the elevation change is 1,250 metres, and   the maximum elevation is 2,287 metres).\n  <em>The risk of grizzly   bear encounters between Scout and Porcupine Camps on the Simpson   River Trail is higher than in other areas of the park.</em>\n</p>\n<h2>\n  Spray Reservoir to Magog Lake</h2>\n<p>\n  Access to the trails entering the park originate from the Spray   Reservoir road located south of Canmore, Alberta. The road leads   south from Canmore for approximately 15 km to the junction of   the Smith Dorian Highway. Follow the Smith Dorian Highway for   approximately 39 km to the turn-off marked Shark Mountain. There   is a parking lot located 7 km from this turn-off. The trail   to the park starts here and leads along the shore of Watridge   Lake, crossing two bridges before meeting the Bryant Creek Trail   (in Banff National Park). From this point the trail follows   Bryant Creek to Assiniboine Pass (distance travelled is 21 km,   estimated hiking time is 6 hours). Banff National Park offers   several campgrounds and a primitive sleeping shelter along Bryant   Creek. Visitors choosing to stay in the Bryant Creek Shelter   or camp in Banff National Park are required to have a backcountry   permit. Visitors can reserve the backcountry permit and obtain   up to date trail information for Banff National Park at 403   762-1556. Trail reports and detailed backcountry trip planning   information for Banff are also available on the\n  <a href=\"http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/pn-np/ab/banff/index.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Banff   National Park website</a>.</p>\n<p>Magog Lake   is 4 km farther, and should take one hour to reach. Elevation   change for this hike is 520 metres, and the maximum elevation   is 2,195 metres. An alternative trail follows Bryant Creek and   skirts Marvel Lake on its way to Wonder Pass (22 km, approximately   6 hours). Magog Lake is a further 4.5 km, and can be hiked in   just over an hour. Elevation change for this hike is 700 metres,   and the maximum elevation is 2,378 metres.</p>\n<h2>Highway   93 to Magog Lake via the Mitchell River</h2>\n<p>This little-used   trail starts beyond a mine on the Mitchell River. To reach the   trailhead follow Settlers Road from Highway 93 in Kootenay National   Park for about 14 km and cross the Kootenay River. Follow a   good logging road along the Cross River for 18.4 km and turn   left up the Mitchell River. Parking is at the mine, 6 km farther.   Large ore trucks are hauling on this road,\n  <strong>so use extreme   caution</strong>. For your own safety, permission must be obtained   from the mine operators to cross their property. Just above   the crusher a 4x4 road leads from the property and stops abruptly   at a steep grade. The trail starts at the base of this hill   and follows the Mitchell River to Wedgewood Lake and then to Magog Lake (distance of hike is about 30 km, and hiking time   is about 8 hours; elevation change is 1,100 metres). Although   the trail crosses the Mitchell River in numerous locations it   is not necessary to make all the crossings, as they are connected   by short and very easy bushwhacks. Stay on the east side to   the ford (see map) then cross over to the west.</p>\n<h2>Sunshine   Ski Village to Magog Lake</h2>\n<p>The access road to Sunshine Village   is 10 km west of Banff on Highway 1 in Banff National Park.   Public vehicle traffic is permitted to Bourgeau parking lot   only, a distance of 9 km. From this point, visitors may hike   6 km to Sunshine Village. From Sunshine Village the trail leads   to Magog Lake via Quartzridge, Citadel Pass, Golden Valley and   Valley of the Rocks (a distance of 27 km, with an estimated   hiking time of 8 hours, an elevation change of 488 metres and   a maximum elevation of 2,408 metres.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"hiking\">Mount Assiniboine Provincial Park: Hiking</a>\n  </li>\n</ul>",

Mackenzie and his party   trekked overland from the Fraser River, across the Interior Plateau,   through the Rainbow Mountains and down Burnt Bridge Creek. Where   the creek enters the Bella Coola River, they rested at a community   which was dubbed “Friendly Village” because of the hospitality   of its Nuxalk inhabitants. These people guided Mackenzie and his   men down the river into Dean Channel. A dispute between the Nuxalk   and the coastal Heiltsuk people prevented them from reaching the   open sea, but Mackenzie was satisfied that his mission was complete.\n  <br>\n  <br>In his journals   he wrote: “<em>I now mixed up some vermilion in melted grease,   and inscribed in large characters on the face of the rock on which   we slept last night, this brief memorial; ‘Alexander Mackenzie from   Canada, by land, the twenty-second of July, one thousand, seven   hundred and ninety-three’</em>”.<br>\n  <br>A prominent   40 foot cairn stands above the rock, and a plaque, erected in 1926   by the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada, is also located   in the park. The cairn also marks the location of a historical fortified   First Nations village, and petroglyphs can be found at the cobble   beach.\n</p>\n<a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>Cultural   Heritage</h2>\n<p>\n  Sir Alexander   Mackenzie Provincial Park is recognized as a cultural heritage site.   Long before Europeans discovered North America, First Nations peoples   used a network of trails between the west coast and the interior   of British Columbia for trade and travel. Because these trails were   commonly used to transport eulachon (a small, smelt-like fish) grease,   they are now referred to as “grease trails”. Hikers attempting the   Alexander Mackenzie Heritage (Grease) Trail will complete their   journey by travelling by boat to the park. The trail’s major appeal   is the opportunity for long-distance wilderness travel along an   historic route that follows the footsteps of First Nations peoples,   Alexander Mackenzie, and other explorers.<br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Please note:</strong>\n  It is an offence to damage historical sites or remove artifacts.\n</p>\n<a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>Conservation</h2>\n<p>Marine resources   have been under a lot of pressure over the last few years. Please   observe fishing regulations closely, and consider taking less than   your limit to ease your impact.</p>\n<a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>Wildlife</h2>\n<p>As you cruise through the waters near the park, watch for orcas, Pacific white-sided dolphins, harbour seals and other marine mammals. It is important you keep your distance from these creatures – never approach closer than 100 metres. Steer a steady, slow course and avoid cutting in front of them.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  On shore, watch for Columbia black-tailed deer, mink, black bear and wolves.\n</p>",

Listed below are descriptions of 14 trails of varying lengths and   difficulty. Lengths, suggested hiking times (one way, unless otherwise   noted), elevation changes and levels of difficulty are approximate   and are based on summer hiking conditions.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Old Buck  Trail</strong>: Length, 2.3 km to the Baden-Powell Trail junction.  Suggested hiking time, 45 minutes. A longer hike is the 5.5  km route   to Perimeter Trail junction, which should take two hours. Total  elevation change is 670 metres. The trailhead is located near  the   park entrance across the road from the Gatehouse. The trail winds  its way up to the beginning of the Perimeter Trail following  the   grade of an old logging road, thus providing hikers with a reflection  of the historic development of Mount Seymour. This hike is  rated   moderate.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Old Buck   Access</strong>: Length, 1 km. Suggested hiking time is 30 minutes (with  minimal elevation change). This hike is rated easy. The trail begins  at the Vancouver Picnic Area parking lot. This short trail terminates  at the junction with the Old Buck Trail.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Horse Trail</strong>:   Length of this loop is 2.5 km. Essentially an old logging road,   this trail is used primarily by mountain biking enthusiasts. At   one time the trail was travelled by equestrians, an activity that   is no longer recommended.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>The Mushroom   Parking Lot</strong>: Length, 750 metres. Suggested hiking time is 15  minutes (with minimal elevation change). The trail begins just  across  the road from the Vancouver Picnic Area parking lot and offers  hikers an opportunity to experience more of Mount Seymour's past  as it  developed toward a major ski area. This hike, not surprisingly,  is rated easy.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Baden-Powell</strong>:   The Baden-Powell Trail was a British Columbia Centennial project   initiated in 1967 by the Girl Guides and Boy Scouts of Canada. Completed   in 1971, the trail connects Deep Cove on Indian Arm with Eagle Ridge   Drive near Horseshoe Bay, a distance of 42 km. About 5 km of the   trail are in the park and may be accessed from the Baden-Powell   picnic area and parking lot located 2 km along the main road from   the park entrance. One section of the trail leads west from here   to the Mushroom Trail junction; the length is 1.7 km, the suggested   hiking time is 40 minutes, and the elevation change is 130 metres.   The other section of the trail leads east to Deep Cove; the length   is 3.2 km, the suggested hiking time is one hour, and the elevation   change is 275 metres. These sections of the trail are considered   moderate. Condition of the trail outside park boundaries varies   considerably so please use caution.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Perimeter</strong>:   Length, 1.5 km. Suggested hiking time, 45 minutes. Elevation change,   240 metres. The trail begins at the Deep Cove lookout and ends at   the Goldie Lake access trail junction. This hike is rated moderate.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Old Cabin</strong>:   Length, 430 metres. Suggested hiking time, 20 minutes. Elevation   change, 25 metres. This is a short connector trail that runs from   Parking Lot 1 to the Perimeter Trail junction. This trail is rated   easy.\n<br>\n<p></p>\n<strong>Dinky Peak</strong>:   Length, 750 metres. Suggested hiking time, 15 minutes. Elevation   change is minimal. This is a short, scenic trail that starts 250   metres along the main Mount Seymour Trail and which leads to the   peak of Dinky Bluff, affording a beautiful view of the lower mainland.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Goldie Lake   Loop</strong>: Length, approximately 2 km from the parking lot. Suggested   hiking time for the complete loop is one hour. Elevation change   is minimal. This is a self-guided interpretive trail that starts   by the First Aid building and winds its way past the Goldie Rope   Tow area to Goldie Lake. This trail also connects with the Flower   Lake Trail and the top end of the Perimeter Trail system. Its rating   is easy.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Flower Lake   Loop</strong>: Length, 1.5 km. Suggested hiking time is 45 minutes. Elevation   change is 150 metres. This is a pleasant trail that starts 500 metres   along the Goldie Lake Trail and leads through sub-alpine bog and   pond communities. Hikers are afforded the opportunity to see a variety   of bird species. The hike is rated easy.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>First Lake   Loop and Dog Mountain</strong>: Length is 1 km to First Lake, 2 km from   First Lake to Dog Mountain (one way), and 3 km from First Lake to   complete loop. Suggested hiking times are: 30 minutes to First Lake;   40 minutes from First Lake to Dog Mountain; 45 minutes for loop   trail from First Lake. The elevation changes are: to First Lake   and Dog Mountain, minimal; Loop Trail, 60 metres. The trail begins   just northwest of the chairlift and climbs gently through dense   sub-alpine old-growth fir forest to First Lake and the trail junction   for Dog Mountain or Mount Seymour. From this junction follow the   trail west to Dog Mountain for a spectacular view of Greater Vancouver   and the Seymour River Valley, or else follow the trail north from   the junction towards Mount Seymour and eventually loop around back   down to the parking lot. This hike is moderate.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Mount Seymour</strong>:   Length, 4 km. Suggested hiking time, 2.5 hours. Elevation change,   450 metres. This busy trail starts near the north end of the top   parking lot, traversing Brockton Point and First and Second Pump   Peaks. From the summit there is a panoramic view of Vancouver, the   lower mainland and, on a clear day, the Gulf Islands and Vancouver   Island. This hike is rated moderate to difficult.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Mystery Lake</strong>:   Length, 1.5 km. Suggested hiking time, 45 minutes. Elevation change,   180 metres. This popular summer trail begins at the north end of   Parking Lot 4 and follows along the chairlift right-of-way to the   lake. There are no fish in the lake but it is a refreshing swimming   spot on a hot summer day. This is considered a moderate hike.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Elsay Lake</strong>:  Length, 7 km. Suggested hiking time is 9-10 hours return. Elevation    change, 500 metres. This rugged trail begins on the main Mount  Seymour Trail and follows it until the trail divides just before  First Pump   Peak. The trail is well developed until a point northwest of Gopher  Lake where the trail narrows and is marked with flashers and  tape.   Sections of the trail can be extremely rugged and easy to lose  in inclement weather. An emergency shelter is located at the end of the trail for emergency use only.\n<strong>Only experienced and well equipped backcountry  travellers should hike this trail. Hikers are encouraged to plan    their hike with an early departure, and not to underestimate the  travel time required.</strong>\nThis trail is considered difficult.  Best hiked late June through October.<br>\n<p></p>",

Just before you reach the Fisheries   Pool campground on the park road there is a trailhead for the Confluence/Trail.   This 1 km. trail leads to a popular fishing hole — but take great   caution as it is also very popular with\n<a href=\"/know-before/wildlife-safety/bear-safety.html\" class=\"legacy-link\">bears</a>. Both facilities contain   water, firepits, tables, firewood and pit toilets for the disabled.   Most trailers and recreational vehicles can be accommodated although   no hook-ups are provided. The park also provides seven day-use facilities   located along Highway 20, with a sani-station open from May 1 –   October 15.\n<br>\n<br>The Rainbow   Range north of Highway 20 offers a network of excellent backpacking   and horsepacking trails and wilderness campsites. There are incredible   views of the surrounding Coast Range Mountains from the open, sub-alpine   meadows. There are a lot of primitive campsites dotted throughout   the park; please read the\n<a href=\"hiking\">hiking</a>\nlink page to get directions for the following listings. On the Rainbow   Day-Use Trail there is some overnight camping but no facilities   at Lake “M”. On the Crystal Lake Trail there are campsites at Lester's   Camp on Young Creek and on the lakeshore at Crystal Lake. Boyd Pass area has the newly restored Rainbow Cabin (aka, Mackenzie and Walker cabin); there is a bear cache and a primitive pit toilet. Octopus   Lake Trail provides Octopus Lake Hikers Camp (bugs are very bad   in July and August); a horse camp is on the opposite side of the   trail 1 km to the west of the lakeshore.\n<br>\n<br>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"winter\" href=\"/\"></a>Winter Recreation</h2>\n<h4>Snowmobiling in Tweedsmuir Provincial Park (South)</h4>\n<br>\n<strong>HOW TO GET THERE</strong>\n<br>\nAn area is  zoned for snowmobiling at Heckman Pass. Snowmobiling is not permitted  elsewhere in the park.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe snowmobile area is accessed through the Rainbow Range trailhead,  located about 40 kilometres west of Anahim Lake on Highway 20.\n<a href=\"tweeds_snowmobile.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"legacy-link\">Click here [PDF]</a>\nto view a map of the snowmobiling area.<br>\n<br>The Rainbow Range is the winter home of a large herd of woodland  caribou and about 100 mountain goats. Both these populations are  considered threatened, and animals are easily disturbed by recreationists.\n<br>\n<br>In winter, caribou favour  open windward slopes where snow is thin and they can access their  staple food – ground lichens. However,  caribou will sometimes use deep snow for lift to reach lichens  hanging from tree branches. Mountain goats also eat exposed vegetation,  and tend to stay near the steep rocky terrain they use for an escape  route. They can become particularly stressed when approached from  above.\n<br>\n<br>If you go, please read and observe the following:\n<ul>\n  <li>Stay within   the snowmobile boundary shown on the map. This area is regularly   patrolled by BC Parks staff.</li>\n  <li>Use  only the designated snowmobile trail to access the overnight  cabin,  ski hill and snowmobile area.</li>\n  <li>Carry out   all your garbage.</li>\n  <li>Stay clear   of ski trails.</li>\n  <li>Never run   your machine over areas bare of snow, as this can destroy the   lichens on which the caribou depend.</li>\n  <li>Avoid snowmobiling   over exposed tree tops.</li>\n</ul>\nUse the following   procedures around wildlife:\n<ul>\n  <li>If you observe   caribou or goat tracks, do not follow the tracks.</li>\n  <li>If you see   caribou or goats, do not approach them. Turn off your snowmobile   and allow the animals to move away quietly.</li>\n  <li>After animals   have departed, leave the area. Make every effort to minimize disturbance.</li>\n</ul>\nChasing wildlife   on a snowmobile can be fatal for the animals, who often die of exhaustion   after struggling through deep snow.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>SAFETY</strong>\n<br>\nAnywhere there is snow lying on a slope, there is the possibility  of an avalanche. These snow torrents are deadly and deserve the  utmost respect. Take an avalanche safety course  and be aware of weather forecasts and snow conditions. For more  avalanche information, contact the\n<a href=\"http://www.avalanche.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Canadian  Avalanche Association</a>.  Each person should carry rescue gear: shovel, probe, and avalanche  rescue  beacon.<br>\n<br>Suffocation is a common cause of death after being buried by an  avalanche. It is crucial to find the victim within minutes. The  use of beacons greatly increases the likelihood of survival. Probe  and shovel are necessary because avalanche debris sets up like  concrete, making digging very strenuous.<br>\n<br>The Rainbow Range is very remote and is subject to sever winter  weather. Snowmobilers should prepare for emergencies such as breakdowns  and injuries by carrying tools, spare parts, extra gas and oil,  a first aid kit and survival gear including a portable stove.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>FACILITIES</strong>\n<br>\nThe Tweedsmuir Ski Club operates a cabin close to the downhill  ski area. Overnight stays can be reserved by calling the club  at (250) 982-2231. The Rainbow Cabin, located in the Mackenzie  Valley, is for emergency use only. Free winter camping is permitted  in the Rainbow Range parking lot. There is an outhouse, but you  must either bring your own drinking water or melt snow.<br>\n<br>You can obtain fuel,  basic supplies, and motel accommodation in Anahim Lake or Nimpo  Lake. The nearest RCMP office is in Anahim  Lake, where there is also a 24-hour medical clinic. The closest  hospital is in Bella Coola, over an hour’s drive from the  parking lot.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>MAPS</strong>\n<br>\n1:50,000 NTS topographic maps include: 93C/12<br>",

It is at high elevation on the east slope of the Coast Range   and features seven lakes and short linking creeks and portages.   Because there is no road access, paddlers must either hike in   or charter a floatplane to fly in. The trail in is a strenuous   16-km hike, the Hunlen Falls Trail, described in the Tweedsmuir   (South) Trails web page. Canoe rentals are available from a   park operator, who also collects overnight camping fees. July, August and the first half   of September are the best times to paddle the lake chain. These   months are relatively dry (though you must prepare for cold   rainy weather).\n<a href=\"hunlenfalls.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"legacy-link\">For a map of the Hunlen Falls/Turner   Lake area, click here</a>. [PDF] For   more information on canoe rentals and access to the Turner Lake   Chain, please check the following\n<a href=\"http://www.tweedsmuirair.com/adventures/twc/intro.htm\">non-government   website</a>.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Safety:</strong>\nThe trip is suitable for intermediate or advanced paddlers.   There is no significant moving water in the creek; hazards arise   from wind and waves on the lakes. Wear Personal Flotation Devices   at all times and stay close to shore on the larger lakes. As   this is a multi-day, mountain wilderness trip, you must be completely   self-sufficient. Leave a detailed itinerary with someone trustworthy   at home. The Park Operator at the north end of Turner Lake has   a radio phone for emergency communications. Cell phones do not   work.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Wildlife:</strong>\nThe area is home to grizzly and black bears, as well as moose.   Please do not approach or harass these or any other wildlife.   There are lots of waterfowl (herons, grebes, loons, mergansers,   widgeons, buffleheads, etc.) and birds of prey around the lakes,   and chances are good you will see pine marten, mink, or other\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Fishing:</strong>\nThe lakes abound with coastal cutthroat trout, thanks to pioneer   Ralph Edwards, who somehow stocked them by carrying them up   from the Atnarko River system. Fly fishing in Hunlen Creek is   a popular pastime. Anyone fishing or angling in British Columbia   must have an\n<a href=\"/plan-your-trip/things-to-do/freshwater-fishing\">appropriate licence</a>.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Hiking:</strong>\nMany people choose to combine the canoe trip with a few days   of alpine rambling. There is excellent hiking in the area surrounding   Ptarmigan Lake, which is a moderate day's backpack above Turner   Lake. For details on these and other trails,\n<a href=\"hiking\">click   here</a>.<br>\n<br>\n<h3>Canoe Route Description:</h3>\nThe chain   of lakes forms a J shape, heading south then veering westward.   Turner Lake is the longest at 5 km, and has high mountains only   on one side. As you paddle up the creek and lake chain, the   view shifts with successively higher and sharper peaks visible.   The other three large lakes are Junker, Widgeon and Kidney Lakes.   These, as well as Turner Lake are subject to strong winds, channelled   by the mountains. The energetic can top off the trip with a   hike to Sunshine Lake.<br>\n<br>Portages   are short, well marked, and supplied with canoe rests. They   are not maintained to a standard for canoe carts, however. Always   use the portages where provided. Lining canoes is not allowed   because it disturbs the gravel creek bed, essential to spawning   fish. Route markers are posts with reflective white squares;   campsites have orange markers. The following description is   for the outward portion of the trip.<br>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Turner Lake to Cutthroat Lake</strong>\n    <br>\n    Starting at the dock just south of Turner North campsite,   paddle the length of Turner Lake (about 5 km). Go up the creek   to the left of the campsite. A portage trail starts about   300 metres upstream on the right. This portage is 400 metres   long, through dry pine forest with kinnickinick and lichens   covering the ground. Paddle upstream for about 500 m, then   portage around a short rapid for about 100m. Put in and paddle   the rest of the way up the creek to Cutthroat Lake.</li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Cutthroat   Lake to Vista Lake</strong>\n    <br>\n    Cutthroat Lake is less than 1km long. Look for the white portage   marker at the south end of the lake. The first portage is   400 metres long and it leads to tiny “No Name Lake.”   Another portage starts on the left of the creek at the south   end of this lake, and comes out at Vista Lake after 130 metres.   If you prefer not to load and unload twice, an extra trail   section around No Name Lake links the portage trails.</li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Vista   Lake to Junker Lake</strong>\n    <br>\n    There is a white route marker at the southwest corner of Vista   Lake. Paddle about 400m upstream then take the portage trail   on the left for 100 metres to Junker Lake. To reach the Junker   Lake campsite, turn east and head for the red sand beach.   Caution: if the wind is blowing from the west, you will have   to paddle parallel to the waves. The forested sites (where   campfires are permitted) are at the northwest end of the beach.   Fires are permanently banned at the beachfront sites, but   the view of the glaciated Talchako Mountains is hard to beat.</li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Junker   Lake to Widgeon Lake</strong>\n    <br>\n    Junker is the second-longest of the lakes, at around 3.5 km.   It is prone to strong winds from the west, usually starting   around 9:00 a.m., so it is best to paddle this lake in the   morning when the lake is calm. The 150-m portage trail to   Widgeon Lake may be difficult to spot until you are close   by, as it’s in a small bay at the far end of the lake. The   campground on Widgeon Lake at the end of the trail also has   excellent views.</li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Widgeon   Lake to Kidney Lake</strong>\n    <br>\n    Widgeon Lake is also subject to strong westerly winds, though   it’s smaller, at 2.5 km. The portage trail starts just west   of the creek inflow, and it’s a tough one: over 500 m long   with several uphill sections for a total elevation gain of   40 m. The camping area on Kidney Lake is directly across the   small bay from the end of the portage.</li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Kidney   Lake to Sunshine Lake (hike)</strong>\n    <br>\n    The trailhead for the Sunshine Lake trail is at a small sandy   beach directly south of the campsite, and may be difficult   to access in rough conditions, since paddling parallel to   the waves is tricky. The marker is orange. The 1-hour, 3-km   trail angles upwards through spruce forest onto a ridge with   views of the creek far below, then follows the ridge up into   a zone of subalpine fir, with huckleberries and white rhododendrons   abounding. After crossing a short bog, follow blazes to the   right and across a log bridge to the campsite. Views across   the lake to the south feature more jagged peaks and hanging   glaciers. This also makes a very nice day trip from the campsites   at any of the previous three lakes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Camping Areas:</h3>\nAll camping   areas are equipped with a pit toilet (no toilet paper is supplied)   and a bear-proof food cache. Most have metal fire rings, benches   and worktops for cooking. The style of the bear caches varies:   some are elevated platforms, while others are large metal boxes.\n<br>\n<br>\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <strong>Campground</strong>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <strong>Number of sites</strong>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <strong>Description</strong>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Turner North</td>\n      <td>10 tent pads</td>\n      <td>On northern tip of Turner Lake.

Never cook or store   food in your tent. Strain out food particles then throw used   wash water into the pit toilet.</li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>If you fish</strong>, never clean your catch in camp as this will   attract animals. Puncture the air bladder and throw offal   into deep water. You must have a licence and be familiar with   the regulations. At the time of writing: creek fishing is   prohibited until July 1 each season; in lakes and streams   bait is banned, single barbless hooks only; daily limit 4   with only 2 from streams.</li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Pack out all your garbage</strong>. Food scraps often don't burn fully,   and may attract bears.</li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Be careful with fire</strong>: most of the campsites are in very dry   forest, so always use the metal fire rings, and make sure   your fire is extinguished when you leave. Please conserve   firewood. Bring a camp stove for cooking.</li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Don’t pollute</strong>: never put soap or food scraps into the lakes.   Wash at least 100 m from water sources.</li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Boil or treat drinking water</strong>.</li>\n  <li>It is best to\n    <strong>leave pets at home</strong>.

The trail starts at a parking   area 12 km from Highway 20 along an old tote road that is suitable   only for 4-wheel drive vehicles. Suggested driving time 1.5 hrs;   suggested hiking time, 6-9 hours; elevation change, 800 metres.   Stillwater Lake, 4 km along the valley bottom, is the last source   of drinking water before Turner Lake so fill your canteens here.

The road and the first three kilometres of   the trail should be hiked between late morning and early afternoon,   when bears are the least active. This hike is rated as difficult. From the parking lot at the end of the Tote Road to Stillwater Lake, there are some scree slope washouts on the trail. Use caution when crossing. Due to a forest fire in 2017 there is abundant regrowth of berries approximately halfway along the still water trail for about ½ a km. Hikers are advised to use extreme caution through here as this is high value Grizzly bear habitat. Travel in groups and carry bear spray.

This famous   trail originates at the Blackwater River near Quesnel and leads   300 km across the Interior Plateau and through the park to the trailhead   on Highway 20 and then on to Bella Coola. From there the historic   corridor continues over water for 65 km to\n  <a href=\"../sir_alex/\" class=\"legacy-link\">Sir   Alexander Mackenzie Provincial Park</a>\n  on the north shore of Dean   Channel. The 80-km section of the trail that is contained within   Tweedsmuir Park, which takes about 5-7 days to traverse, is considered   by many to be the most scenic stretch of the entire Mackenzie Heritage   Trail. The trail's major appeal is the opportunity for long-distance   backpacking or horseback riding along a historic route that follows   the footsteps of First Nations Peoples, Alexander Mackenzie, and   other explorers and pioneers. Please contact the Alexander Mackenzie   Heritage Trail Association for more information. Box 425, Station   A, Kelowna, BC, V1Y 7P1 (250) 762-3002.</p>\n<p>Currently, visitor   services are extremely limited, and the trail remains unmarked.   Extended trips along the trail require both stamina, and a high   degree of preparation. Hikers attempting the Nuxalk-Carrier Grease/Alexander Mackenzie Heritage Trail should be self-reliant and experienced in wilderness   travel. Hiking the entire trail requires approximately 3 weeks;   portions of the hike through Tweedsmuir (South) Provincial Park   are isolated, so it is recommended that visitors hike in groups   of at least three. Portions of the Nuxalk-Carrier Grease/Alexander Mackenzie Heritage Trail within Tweedsmuir Park have been cleared of deadfall in 2019 (Rainbow Cabin to Mackenzie Pass) and 2020 (Hwy 20 towards Hump Lake). The rest of the trail has been unmaintained. Arrangements should be made well in advance for   food and supply drops; one drop halfway is essential. This hike   is rated as difficult. An excellent trail guide is available for   purchase from the Alexander Mackenzie Trail Association.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>\n    <em>Trails starting from Turner Lake</em>\n  </strong>\n  <em>:</em>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Ptarmigan Lake</strong>\n  - Length, 12 km; suggested hiking time, 5   hours; elevation change, 600 metres.<br>\n  This high-altitude trail starts near Hunlen Falls and climbs steadily   through a mature pine forest to the alpine and a campsite at the   north end of the lake. This is a moderate hike. The trail was cleared of deadfall in 2018.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Panorama Lakes Loop Trails</strong>\n  - This trail system consists of two loop trails that can be hiked in either direction. The trails should be considered routes as there is no discernable trail in several sections. Connect Ptarmigan Lake with Janet Lake, Molly Lake, Echo Lake and Rosemary Pass. Since these routes are in high subalpine and alpine, they are marked by cairns, which may be difficult to find in some areas or see in bad weather. You should bring a topographic map and compass, and know how to use them. Please stay on route/trail wherever possible, to avoid damaging the delicate alpine vegetation. It is recommended that hikers allow sufficient time for route finding and be prepared for challenging conditions.\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Ptarmigan Lake/Echo Lake/Rosemary Pass</strong>\n    - Length, 14 km. Moderate. This loop starts at the Echo Lake/Ptarmigan Lake trail junction, and climbs to the top of the ridge between South Goat Creek and Ptarmigan Lake. As the route descends toward Echo Lake, the hanging glaciers of Glacier Mountain dominate the view. The route is very steep in sections. Watch for cairns, especially the two large ones located on either side of a narrow valley just before Echo Lake. The route follows the north shores of Echo and Gem Lakes, leading to a long uphill traverse. Enjoy the views of Panorama Ridge with its hanging valleys, horned peaks, glaciers, and waterfalls. From Rosemary Pass the route/trail descends to the east side of Rosemary Lake, crosses the creek and follows the west shore of Ptarmigan Lake.</li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Ptarmigan Lake/Molly Lake/Rosemary Pass</strong>\n    - Length, 14 km. Moderate. This loop starts at the Ptarmigan Lake campsite and follows the cairns north towards Whistler Pass before turning west to Janet Lake. It travels southwest along the north side of Janet Lake, and then climbs to the boulder-strewn skyline of Janet Pass. Several small lakes are visible from here: Molly Lake is downhill and on the right. On the east shore of Molly Lake is a primitive campsite with spectacular views of the Talchako Mountains. To continue to Rosemary Pass, follow the cairns leading eastward. This is a steep climb. Return to Ptarmigan Lake as described above.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  <em>\n    <strong>Day Hikes:</strong>\n  </em>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Kettle Pond</strong>\n  - This is an easy one hour walk from the Big Rock/Kettle   Pond picnic area around an interesting, glacially-formed “kettle”  pond.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Burnt   Bridge</strong>\n  - This trail starts from the Mackenzie Heritage   Trailhead and leads along Burnt Ridge Creek to a small suspension   bridge, looping back down to the parking area.

      "content": "<a name=\"History\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"History\" href=\"/\"></a>History</h2>\n<p>\n  The park was   established in 1938. It is named for the 15th Governor General of   Canada, John Buchan, who bore the title Baron Tweedsmuir of Elsfield   (and enjoyed a successful side career as a writer of thrillers,   such as The Thirty Nine Steps). The Governor General travelled extensively   by float aircraft and horseback in the park in August of 1937, and   he and his party were greatly impressed by its magnificence. In   a booklet issued to commemorate his visit he stated in the foreword:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  “I have now travelled over most of Canada and have seen many wonderful   things, but I have seen nothing more beautiful and more wonderful   than the great park which British Columbia has done me the honour   to call by my name”.\n</blockquote>\nAlexander Mackenzie   travelled through the area of the park on his epic journey to the   Pacific Ocean in 1793. Mackenzie was the first white man to view   the western seas from the shores of northwest America, ahead of   the more widely known Lewis and Clark expedition by more than 12   years. Mackenzie and his party trekked overland from the Fraser   River, across the Interior Plateau, through the Rainbow Mountains   and down Burnt Bridge Creek. Where the creek enters the Bella Coola   River, they rested at a community they dubbed “Friendly Village”   because of the hospitality of its Nuxalk inhabitants. These people   guided Mackenzie and his men down the river into Dean Channel. A   dispute between the Nuxalk and the coastal Heiltsuk people prevented   them from reaching the open sea, but Mackenzie was satisfied that   his mission was complete. In his journals he wrote:<blockquote>\n  “I now   mixed up some vermilion in melted grease, and inscribed in large   characters on the face of the rock on which we slept last night,   this brief memorial, Alexander Mackenzie, from Canada, by land,   the twenty-second of July, one thousand, seven hundred and ninety-three”.</blockquote>\nMackenzie's rock, on the north shore of Dean Channel, is marked   with a cairn and preserved in\n<a href=\"../sir_alex/\" class=\"legacy-link\">Sir Alexander   Mackenzie Provincial Park</a>.\n<br>\n<br>Lonesome Lake,   in the southeast part of the park, has become well-known through   the publication of books and stories about Ralph Edwards, who settled   at the lake not long after the turn of the century and many years   before the park was created. The struggle of Edwards and his family   to wrest a homestead from this harsh wilderness has made their story   a classic of Canadian pioneering spirit.\n<br>\n<p></p>\n<a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>Cultural Heritage</h2>\n<p>\n  The park and   surrounding areas have been used by the Nuxalk and Carrier First   Nations for thousands of years. Routes known as “grease trails”   enabled the interior peoples to trade furs and obsidian for marine   products such as eulachon grease. The Nuxalk people of the Bella   Coola valley depended on the abundance of salmon in the rivers for   their livelihood. Today, descendants of these earliest inhabitants   catch and process fish from the same rivers in much the same way   as did their ancestors. If you come across any First Nations heritage   sites, do not disturb them or remove artifacts.</p>\n<p>Signs showing information about the Nuxalk and Ulkatcho First Nations, are proudly displayed in Tweedsmuir Park and were developed collaboratively between Nuxalk and BC Parks:</p>\n<p>\n  <a href=\"3.4-nuxalk-first-nation-sign.pdf\" class=\"legacy-link\">\n    <img src=\"images/3.4-nuxalk-first-nation-sign-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"Nuxalk First Nation Sign [PDF]\" class=\"legacy-image\">\n  </a>\n  <a href=\"13.2-eulachon-grease-trail.pdf\" class=\"legacy-link\">\n    <img src=\"images/13.2-eulachon-grease-trail-sign-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Eulachon Grease Trail Sign [PDF]\" class=\"legacy-image\">\n  </a>\n  <a href=\"3.6-ulkatcho-first-nation-sign.pdf\" class=\"legacy-link\">\n    <img src=\"images/3.6-ulkatcho-first-nation-sign-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Ulkatcho First Nation Sign [PDF]\" class=\"legacy-image\">\n  </a>\n</p>\n<a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>Conservation</h2>\n<p>\n  The topography   of the area is extremely varied. East of the park near Anahim Lake,   the Interior Plateau abruptly gives way, at an elevation of about   1,350 metres, to peaks of the Rainbow Range. The range--Tsitsutl,   meaning “painted mountains” in the local dialect--is an enormous   dome of eroded lava and fragmented rock that presents to the viewer   an astonishing spectrum of reds, oranges, yellows and lavenders.<br>\n  <br>Contrasting   with the vivid colouration and gentler slopes of the Rainbow Range   are the higher and more rugged Coast Mountains that mark the western   extremity of the park. Vast glaciers sculptured these granite giants,   leaving behind serrated peaks still under the erosive attack of   alpine ice. Tzeetsaytsul Peak - so named by the Indians for the   rumble and boom of its glacier - and its neighbour, Thunder Mountain,   are dominant features of the park’s western boundary. Monarch   Mountain, in the southwest corner of the park, is, at 3,533 metres,   the highest mountain in the area. Further evidence of the glacial   activity of the past along the park’s west side are the deep   valleys of the Bella Coola and Atnarko Rivers and ocean fjords like   Dean Channel.\n  <br>\n  <br>The climate   and topography influence the type and distribution of vegetation,   with four zones being easily identifiable. Commencing at the coast   and extending inland along the Talchako and Dean Rivers is a coastal   hemlock forest that thrives in this moist area. Farther into the   park the climate is drier since much precipitation has been shed   by the time Pacific air masses have passed through the mountains.   At lower levels and on the plateau, forest cover is a combination   of Douglas-fir and trembling aspen or lodgepole pine interspersed   with natural meadows. High on the mountainsides is dense Englemann   spruce and sub-alpine fir growth that gives way above 1,650 metres   to treeless alpine tundra.<br>\n  <br>Flowers, trees   and shrubs are part of the park’s natural heritage, please don’t   damage or remove them.\n</p>\n<a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>Wildlife</h2>\n<p>\n  Most large mammals   are wide ranging and difficult for the casual visitor to spot. The   alpine and grass meadows north of Highway 20 are the habitat of   grizzly bears, black bears, mountain goats, caribou and wolves and   the summer range of moose and mule deer. In the summer and into   the late fall grizzly bears utilize the Atnarko valley in pursuit   of salmon. Cougar and many other smaller mammals also inhabit the   park. There is also a great variety of bird life in the park, including   the magnificent trumpeter swans that winter at Lonesome Lake.\n  <br>\n  <br>The park is   also known for its coastal cutthroat trout, mountain whitefish,   resident and sea-run Dolly Varden, and runs of chinook, coho, sockeye,   chum, and pink salmon.\n</p>",

The Bulkley Valley is steeped   in history. The beautiful valley and river were named after Colonel   Charles S. Bulkley, U.S. Army, who was commissioned by the Collins   Overland Telegraph Company to construct a line through BC to Alaska,   which would then connect with the Russian system in Siberia by crossing   the Bering Strait. This ambitious project was in a race with another   telegraph line, the Trans-Atlantic Cable.\n  <br>\n  <br>In 1866 the   Trans-Atlantic Cable was successfully completed and consequently   the Collins Telegraph Line was abandoned only two years after it   began. Little remains of the Telegraph Line, but one of the legacies   of it was the original name for the lake, Maclure, named after one   of the original surveyors of the Collins Telegraph Line. The name   was changed to the present name, Tyhee, which means fish in the   native Gitxsan language.\n</p>\n<a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>Cultural Heritage</h2>\n<p>\n  Another interesting   historical feature of Tyhee Lake is the small town of Aldermere   which was part of the “Old Caribou Trail” during the 1800s. The   town was located on the height of land at the southwest end of Tyhee   Lake, walking distance from the present town of Telkwa. The people   used Tyhee Lake for gathering ice used in cold cellars in the summer,   as well as a source of water obtained by filling barrels on wagons   and bringing them up to the town.<br>\n  <br>The town was   quite prosperous when the Collins Telegraph Line pushed through   here. Aldermere consisted of a hotel, livery stables, and a post   office, which neither Telkwa nor Smithers had. With the abandonment   of the Telegraph Line in 1866, Aldermere was well on the way to   dying out by 1914. In 1915 the hotel closed and Smithers and Telkwa   became the more popular towns. Little is left of Aldermere except   for some foundations and timbers, which are now on private land.\n</p>\n<a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2></h2>\n<p></p>\n<a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>Wildlife</h2>\n<p>\n  A stroll to   the marsh viewing platform will provide an opportunity to see a   variety of birds and mammals including common loons, rednecked grebes,   ruffed grouse, downy woodpecker, red-winged blackbird, squirrels,   moose in the winter, black bear (occasionally in summer), and beaver.\n</p>",

You can access the trail from the Stump Lake parking lot   and the Alice Lake south beach area. The trail takes you through   Douglas fir, western red cedar and other coniferous and deciduous   trees. Some of the birds that can be seen are warblers, Steller’s   jay, chickadees and robins. Small animals such as raccoons, squirrels   and chipmunks inhabit the forest and are more apt to be seen by   visitors. A few box turtles have been spotted sunning themselves   on logs at Alice Lake and Stump Lake.</p>\n<p>\n  The section of Four Lakes Trail between Edith Lake and Alice Lake (South Beach) and the trail around Alice Lake are permanently closed to cycling. The remainder of Four Lakes Trail is closed to cycling between May 1 and September 15.</p>\n<p>Please be prepared.   Make sure you have plenty of water and snacks with you while you   are on the trail. Proper footwear is recommended.<br>\n</p>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"debecks\" href=\"/\"></a>DeBeck’s Hill Trail</h2>\n<p>The DeBeck’s   Hill Trail is approximately 3 km round trip.

Moose was a mainstay of these peoples and they travelled the   rivers of the region by canoe. Following the arrival of white man,   native use became closely linked to the fur trade and exploration   work.<br>\n  <br>The first written   recording of the hot springs on the Liard River was made in 1835   by Robert Campbell of the Hudson’s Bay Company. Following Campbell’s   exploration, the Liard River was used as a trading route to the   Yukon. The rapids along the upper Liard River were so treacherous   that this route was abandoned in 1870.<br>\n  <br>The first scientific   exploration of the Liard region was undertaken in 1887 by R. C.   McConnell for the Geological Survey of Canada. William Ogilvie further   explored the Liard in 1888 and 1889; his party camped at Liard Hot   Springs on both expeditions.<br>\n  <br>\n  The first white   man to live at Liard River Hot Springs was Tom Smith, a prospector   in the Klondike Gold Rush, who built and lived with his daughter in a cabin by the Alpha pool in the early 1920’s. They left the area   after two years of trapping; on their way to Fort Liard, Tom was   drowned in the Liard River, while his daughter was rescued by some   local First Nations people, and sent to the Anglican mission at Hay River.<br>\n  <br>The Japanese   thrust to Alaska and the allied commitment to supply war materials   to the Soviet Union spurred construction of the Alcan Military Highway   (Alaska Highway). The 1,600 miles of highway was construction by   10,000 American Army Engineers and 6,000 civilians. The first boardwalk   and pool facilities were built by the American Army in 1942. Liard   River Hot Springs Provincial Park was created in April 1957.\n</p>\n<a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>Cultural Heritage</h2>\n<p></p>\n<a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>Conservation</h2>\n<p>\n  Geology: Liard   River Hot Springs is underlain by folded, faulted sedimentary rock   overlaid by a veneer of glacial drift. The springs may be related   to a major fault system which parallels the valley on the south   side of the Liard River; however, the exact mechanism and source   of the hot springs are unknown. It is believed that ground water   following gravity seeps down through the folded, faulted sedimentary   rock of the Liard Plateau down towards the earths core. The groundwater,   heated and pressurized by hot gases deep underground, strips minerals   from the rocks and is forced back to the surface along natural faults   to emerge as a thermal spring. As the hot springs water bubbles   from the earth it reacts with air and certain minerals are deposited.   Calcium carbonate is one of the minerals that precipitates to form   tufa. Tufa forms the terraced base of the Hanging Gardens. About   eight pools make up the hot springs complex in the park.\n  <br>\n  <br>Unlike most   other thermal springs in Canada, Liard River Hot Springs does not   flow directly into a nearby river or creek, but into an intricate   system of swamps. These warm swamps are the most unique feature   of the park; these swamps create a micro climate allowing a unique   vegetative community to thrive here.<br>\n  <br>Liard River   Hot Springs lies in the Liard River Valley and is located in the   Liard -Rabbit Plateau. The park lies within the Boreal Black and   White Spruce biogeoclimatic zone. The majority of the 250 plant   species in the park are of the boreal variety. However, the effect   of the hot springs accounts for the occurrence of 14 thermally influenced   species.<br>\n  <br>The hot spring   vegetation is striking compared to outlying areas in species composition,   in the large diversity of species (including 14 species of orchids)   and the luxuriance of its growth and its early-blooming growth pattern.<br>\n  <br>There are   several plant communities in the park that exhibit thermal effects.   The pools themselves create a rich environment for growth. Ostrich\n  <em>ferns (Matteuccia struthiopteris</em>) gives the springs a   tropical look as well as cow\n  <em>parsnip (Heracleum lanatum</em>)   that grows to extremely tall heights. Thermally influenced species   that thrive near the spring include black snakeroot (<em>Sanicula   marililanda</em>), Lyall’s\n  <em>nettle (Urtica lyallii</em>)   and yellow monkey flower (<em>Mimulus guttatus</em>).<br>\n  <br>The occurrence   of tufa (calcium deposts precipitated from hot springs water) influences   the hot springs vegetation pattern. Tufa forms the base for the   spectacular greenery and flowers that grow at the Hanging Garden.<br>\n  <br>The warm water   swamps although being extremely shallow never freeze in winter due   to the continual inflow of warm water. The vegetation here is very   interesting and often overlooked. Aquatic plants include the bladderworts,   butterwort and sundews which are all carniverous plants. The carniverous   plants are likely due to the low nitrogen content of the spring   water. Several species of orchids and the uncommon Kalms\n  <em>lobelia   (Lobelia kalmii</em>) are found on tufa islands. Successional meadows   supporting cinquefoil (<em>Potentilla fruticosa</em>) shrubs occur   in previously wet swampy areas.\n</p>\n<a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>Wildlife\n</h2>\n<p>\n  <img src=\"liard_hs4.jpg\" alt=\"photo of moose\" class=\"legacy-image\">\n  A total of 104   bird species and 28 mammals have been recorded at Liard River Hot   Springs. Moose are year-round residents and provide the most consistent   viewing opportunities. During the summer months, bulls, cows and   calves are observed feeding on acquatic vegetation in the swamps.\n  <br>\n  <br>Mallard ducks   and Canada geese are known to breed in the area. Shorebirds such   as the solitary sandpiper and common snipe breed in the swamp. Gulls,   swallows, blackbirds, kingfishers and nighthawks are frequently   observed near the swamp, while flocks of bohemian waxwings use black   spruce perches around the edges of the swamp. Many species of woodpeckers,   thrushes, warblers and sparrows have also been observed in the park.\n  <br>\n  <br>Of particular   interest to visitors are the numerous small fishing swimming in   pools alongside the boardwalk to Alpha pool. The tiny lake chub   that swim back and forth under the boardwalk are unique due to their   ability to survive in the warm water of the swamp.\n</p>",

The Muskwa Ranges of the northern Rocky Mountains contain complex   folds, wide U-shaped valleys and rugged peaks of Paleozoic limestone   and quartzite. In comparison to the southern Rocky Mountains, the   older Muskwa Ranges show evidence of more complex, tectonic deformation   during their uplifting and development over 50 million years ago.   Throughout Stone Mountain, there are examples of tilted sedimentary   strata, folds, faults and synclines. Valley bottoms in the headwaters   of MacDonald Creek are characterized by vertical beds which protrude   through scree less resistant to erosion.<br>\n  <br>A more localized   sub-range of the Muskwas, the Stone Range represents a heavily eroded   and horizontally-bedded landscape typical to northern portion of   the park. Mt. St. Paul at 2127m is composed of layered sedimentary   rock, mostly seabed dolomite, laid down in Devonian times and raised   along with the rest of the area approximately 80-90 million years   ago.<br>\n  <br>The topography   of Stone Mountain Park is steep, with elevations ranging from 1200m   to 2500m. Elevations within the park exceed 2300m only in the southern   potion of the MacDonald Creek headwaters. Mt. St. Magnus at 2550m   serves as a southern boundary marker and represent the highest mountain   in the park.<br>\n  <br>Glaciation has   been responsible for forming the present-day landscape. A large   ice sheet extended over the park and scoured the lower peaks of   the Stone Range. The U-shaped MacDonald valley illustrates one of   the many ice valleys in the area. As glacial ice melted, the area   of Summit Lake received an immense deposition of gravel and boulders;   this was followed by an intense period of fluvial erosion. As a   result, major outwash plains were formed in the headwaters of the   North Tetsa River. Five distinct terrace levels indicate the intensity   of fluvial action that scoured this particular portion of the park.<br>\n  <br>Runoff is a   dominant hydrological process in Stone Mountain due to steep slopes,   little soil and vegetation and the amount of rainfall. A variety   of water bodies and kettle holes scattered throughout the park are   recharged by spring meltwater and summer rains. Deep canyons trace   the flow of intermittent creeks.<br>\n  <br>Summit Lake   is the largest water body in the park. The deep blue waters are   recharged annually by snow melt and precipitation. West of the pass   lies Rocky Crest Lake, a small sub-alpine lake. Between these two   lakes, a broad wetland marks the divide between the watersheds of   the Tetsa-Muskwa and Racing-Toad River systems. Although the Tetsa   River drains to the east and the Toad to the west, both river ultimately   run into the Arctic Ocean via the Mackenzie River.<br>\n  <br>A unique outwash   plain formation lies in the headwaters of the North Tetsa River,   southeast of Mt. St. George. A series of stepped terraces record   the catastrophic drainage pattern which occurred during the later   stages of the glacial retreat. As Summit Lake was blocked by ice   and debris, outwash from the retreating MacDonald valley glacier   escaped south of Mt. St. George carrying glacial drift down the   valley of the North Tetsa. Water erosion, caused by the melting   ice-front in the Tetsa headwaters, quickly carved an intricate pattern   of channels thorough the newly deposited till.<br>\n  <br>Due to its mountainous   location, Stone Mountain Park supports only two biogeoclimatic zones.   The subalpine spruce/willow/birch zone contains open forests of   mainly white spruce and subalpine fir. A stand of lodgepole pine   north of Summit Lake Campground, is indicative of a wildfire which   probably occurred during the construction of the Alaska Highway.   Above 1500m lies the alpine tundra zone. Scrub birch and willow   species are found along wet areas, and grasses and alpine flowers   occur in areas that have enough soil to support them. On shady sites   in upland locations, small basins of alpine muskeg occur. These   boggy areas are accumulations of moss layers that have grown in   successive layers over glacial till. When walked upon, the ground   of these areas feels soft and spongy. Please be careful and avoid   these areas, as they are very sensitive to trampling and major disturbance.   Alpine meadows host the southern limit of the Lapland rosebay shrub.   This small shrub is from the rhododendron genus and bears showy   clusters of bright rose-purple flowers. Unlike other rhododendrons,   the Lapland rosebay grows on calcium-rich soils.\n</p>\n<a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>Wildlife</h2>\n<p>\n  Few furbearing   mammals inhabit Stone Mountain Park. High elevations and harsh winter   conditions limit the range of many species. Squirrel, hoary marmot   and chipmunk are the more observable species. Other species known   to occur include grizzly and black bear, wolf, coyote, lynx, marten,   fisher and beaver. Populations of caribou, stone sheep and mountain   goat winter in the park. Caribou and stone sheep are visible along   the highway. Please reduce speeds and watch for wildlife when travelling   the Alaska Highway. Other ungulates that use the park in summer   include mule deer and elk. Summit and Rocky Crest Lakes are congregation   areas for migratory birds. Raptors, such as golden eagles, can be   seen circling the skies. Many other avian species occur, but have   not been recorded. Ptarmigan are a common sight above treeline.<br>\n  <br>Summit Lake   offers angling opportunities to visitors. The lake has been stocked   in past years with rainbow and lake trout and mountain fish are   also present. Summit Lake is a low productivity lake, with fish   exhibiting slow growth and late maturation. As a result, fish populations   are easily overfished. Please be prudent and refer to the current\n  <a href=\"/plan-your-trip/things-to-do/freshwater-fishing\">BC Environment Fishing Regulations Synopsis</a>.

They flock to these feeding grounds to feast  on the high-protein chum salmon carcasses - all that remains  of the salmon run. Bald Eagles have been returning  to the estuary in greater numbers recently, now that the estuary has been  closed to public access.\n</p>\n<p>In the winter  of 1990-1991, a quiet zone was created on the lower stretch of  the Goldstream River. This Quiet Zone resulted  in increasing  numbers of Bald Eagles. Four years later, in the fall of 1994,  a Black Bear entered the estuary to feed on the salmon. Rather  than removing the Black Bear, the estuary was closed off to  the public for the duration of the salmon run. The absence of  people  in the area also provided eagles with a space to feed without  human interruption. Since closing off the estuary, the number  of eagles  feeding on the salmon carcasses has risen from a yearly high  of 12 to one of more than 200. More recently, the estuary  has been  closed all year-round, a conservation strategy that has encouraged  a pair of eagles to nest here as well. Even a single hiker  or kayaker can cause the eagles to fly to safety and miss one  of their daily  meals. Please help us ensure that eagles continue to return  to  Goldstream by respecting the signs around the estuary.<br>\n</p>\n<h2>\n  Tips for Eagle Watchers<br>\n</h2>\nThese Bald  eagles have traveled hundreds of kilometres to reach the Goldstream  estuary in time for this annual feast of spawned-out  salmon. They can only feed during the low tides, when the dead  salmon are exposed. Visitors must remember that the wildlife  comes first, so please follow a few guidelines when visiting:\n<ul>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Bring  binoculars and a camera. Because of changes in the way BC Parks  manages the estuary, the Bald eagles and other birds of prey  are more visible than ever before!\n    </li>\n    <li>The estuary  and quiet zone along the river are closed to the public - these  areas have been set aside for wildlife. Please pass the  word on to kayakers and boaters.</li>\n    <li>Please  carpool if possible; there is limited parking.\n    </li>\n    <li>A viewing  platform near the Visitor Centre allows visitors to get as  close as possible to the eagles. Be sure to approach it slowly  and quietly.</li>\n    <li>The best  time to view undisturbed eagle feeding behaviour is during  a low tide, which is usually in the morning during the winter.  A remote control eagle camera is set up in the Visitor  Center,  which allows you to zoom in on the birds in the estuary.</li>\n    <li>We encourage  you to leave your dog at home. If you do decide to bring a  dog it must kept be on a leash and on the trails.</li>\n    <li>Do not  leave your wallet, purse or other valuables in your car.\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n</ul>\nVisit the  park again in the spring to mark the progress of the Bald Eagle  nesting season.",

In 1961,   it was established as a Class A Park. It was named for John Bowron,   the first Gold Commissioner of nearby Barkerville. There are several   trappers’ cabins along the circuit, dating from the 1920s. Although   no intensive gold mining occurred in what is now Bowron Lake Park,   the surrounding area has a rich history from the Cariboo Gold Rush   of the 1860s.\n</p>\n<a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>Cultural   Heritage</h2>\n<p>\n  Bowron Lake   Park has a strong history of First Nations and European use and   settlement. Much of this use has been intertwined with the presence   of plentiful wildlife and rich fisheries in the park. The physical   evidence of the park’s heritage is distributed throughout. Some   evidence, like the old trappers’ cabins, is in plain sight while   some evidence lies buried. In other cases, the history of the area   exists only in the memories and stories of First Nation elders or   handed down to second and third generation landowners and local   historians.\n  <br>\n  <br>While the word “wilderness” is often used to describe Bowron Lake Park,   its mountains, lakes and rivers have been used for food, shelter   and sustenance, economic development and recreation long before   society decided to protect it as a provincial park. The marks and   evidence of its former residents and users can be found in the old   cabins, trails, axe blazes, crumbling chimneys, rotting mileposts,   the occasional projectile point and the long since removed rail   portages.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>First Nations Use\n  </strong>\n  <br>\n  Many early European   visitors to the area wrote about the First Nations people they encountered.   They talked about the trapping, hunting, fishing and gathering activities   of these people and speculated about which “people” they   were. Early accounts suggest they were the “Takulli” or   Carrier people, but others mentioned Shuswap or even Iroquois. Many   of these accounts refer to a village situated at Bear (Bowron) Lake   complete with between nine to eleven kekuli (pit) houses and approximately   100 people. As in many First Nations communities, the smallpox epidemics   of the 1860s struck hard in this community. The village site itself   apparently sloughed into Bowron Lake in 1964. Some reports attribute   this sloughing to undermining and mud slides, while others blame   the event on the seismic shock from the 1964 earthquake in Anchorage,   Alaska. Other First Nations sites have been noted, including clam   middens, buried campfires, projectile points and cache pits, but   little formal archaeological or traditional use work has occurred.\n  <br>\n  <br>Many of the   place names in Bowron Lake Park have their origins in the Carrier   language, including Mt. Ishpa (meaning “my father”), Kaza   Mountain (meaning “arrow”), the Itzul Range (meaning “forest”)   and the Tediko Range (meaning “girls”). Lanezi Lake is   also derived from Carrier language and means “long”. Lanezi   was known as Long Lake for years.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>The Gold Rush</strong>\n  <br>\n  The Cariboo   Gold Rush of the 1860s brought many of the first non-natives into   the Cariboo Mountains. Miners and prospectors working along the   Fraser River tributaries eventually founded the mining town at Quesnel   Forks. Continuing upstream past Cariboo Lake, they came upon what   they called Swamp River. This may have been the area in\n  <a href=\"../cariboo_rv/\" class=\"legacy-link\">Cariboo   River Park</a>. As the miners and prospectors continued on, they   would have found Cariboo Falls, and then Unna Lake, Babcock Lake   and others in the chain. They likely would have continued up the   Matthew River, exploring the valley and perhaps spending time at   Ghost Lake in\n  <a href=\"../cariboo_mt/\" class=\"legacy-link\">Cariboo Mountains Park</a>.   Miners prospecting from Williams Creek and Antler Creek would have   eventually found Bowron Lake (then known as “Bear Lake”),   since the Antler River joins the Bowron River right below Bowron   Lake.\n  <br>\n  <br>Exploration   of the Bowron and Cariboo Mountains country continued throughout   the 1860s and onward. Canadian Pacific Railroad engineers looked   for links through the mountain passes and John Bowron, the Gold   Commissioner, sent parties exploring into the hills to look for   new gold-bearing ground and routes. One of the routes from the Cariboo   to Tete Jaune Cache in the Robson Valley was located along the Goat   River Pass. Mileposts were put in and the trail was cleared enough   for dog sleds in the winter. The Grand Trunk Railroad, which was   built in 1914, put an end to the effectiveness of the Goat River   route. Another route through the mountains, called the “Dominion   Route” was located between Lanezi Lake and Castle Creek.<br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Settlement</strong>\n  <br>\n  From the earliest   days of non-native settlement in the Cariboo Mountains, Bowron Lake   played a central role. Early entrepreneurs in Barkerville caught   kokanee in the lake and sold them to the hungry miners. (Rumour   has it an ounce of gold bought a pound of the tasty salmon!) After   the gold rush was over, trapping and guiding began to play a larger   role in the economy of the area. After the First World War, returning   soldiers were given land grants, and a number of families began   farming along the Bowron River. Several lodges were built around   the lake, and guides with names like Kibbee and Wendle were bringing   in tourists for big game hunting.<br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Establishment of the Park</strong>\n  <br>\n  By the early   1920s there was a concern that wildlife populations were under increasing   stress in the Bowron Lake area. Thomas McCabe, John Babcock and   Joe Wendle proposed a no-hunting conservation area around the inside   of the chain of lakes as a wildlife sanctuary where animals could   reproduce without disturbance, using Yellowstone and Glacier National   parks as examples. A 240 square mile reserve was established in   1925. Since 1925, Bowron Lake Park has been enlarged a number of   times in order to make the boundaries make more ecological sense   and to increase recreational access to the lakes. The largest additions   came in 1961 when it was originally designated a park and in 2000   with the addition of the Betty Wendle, Wolverine and portions of   the Upper Cariboo River.\n</p>\n<a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>Conservation</h2>\n<p>\n  The park is   a wildlife sanctuary and is closed to hunting. Increased park visitation   during recent years has placed a great deal of pressure on the park’s   resources. If we are able to preserve the wilderness experience,   it is up to each visitor to treat this special area with the respect   it deserves by following the park’s rules and regulations.\n</p>\n<a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>Wildlife</h2>\n<p>\n  One of the reasons   Bowron Lake Park attracts so many visitors is the high likelihood   of wildlife sightings. You may encounter both moose and bear. Never   stress wildlife by approaching too closely. Binoculars and a telephoto   lens are well worth bringing on your trip.\n  <br>\n  <br>A wide variety   of wildlife lives in the park, including moose, deer, mountain goat   caribou, black bear, grizzly bear, waterfowl, beaver, and otter.   Rainbow trout, lake trout, bull trout, Rocky Mountain whitefish   and Kokanee salmon inhabit the waters of the park. In the winter,   trumpeter swans depend on the open waters of the Bowron Marsh and   Cariboo River.\n</p>",

If you  come well prepared, it is a marvellous experience: enjoy the serenity, beautiful  mountain views and abundant wildlife.\n<br>\n<br>The  Circuit requires over 100 kilometres of paddling – mostly on large lakes with  some on fast flowing rivers (class 1, high volume when in flood). There are also  11 kilometres of portage trails, over which you must carry all your gear as well  as the canoe. Winds and cold, rainy weather are frequent throughout the summer,  and storms may blow up at short notice, so be prepared to spend days on shore  waiting for conditions to improve. Paddle close to shore, as the lakes are very  cold and a capsize far from shore could have severe consequences. Wear a PFD (personal  flotation device) at all times.\n<br>\n<br>As an alternative to the full Circuit, paddling only the West Side is easier, with  no fast moving water, and it takes just 2 to 4 days.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Canoe or Kayak?</strong>\nMost people paddle the Circuit in 16- to 18-foot tandem (two-seater)  canoes, as these are the most efficient in terms of carrying people and gear where  frequent portages interrupt paddling. Canoes constructed of fibreglass, Kevlar,  aluminum, or plastic composites such as Royalex are the best choices. For your  safety, you must ensure that you can load all your equipment and both people in  your canoe and still have\n<strong>at least 15 cm (6\") of freeboard</strong>\nwhen the canoe  is in the water. (Freeboard is the vertical distance between the water and the  lowest point on the rim of the canoe.) Try this on a lake close to home before  you leave. If there is less than 15 cm of freeboard, you either have too much  gear or too small a canoe.\n<br>\n<br>Sea  kayaks have gained in popularity over the last few years, since they are easier  to learn to paddle, handle better in wind and, if solo, give a sense of independence.  The disadvantages of kayaks on the Bowron Circuit are their relative weight (two  50 lb. kayaks versus one 60 lb. canoe); they cannot be portaged over the shoulders  like a canoe; and difficulty in packing and repacking into a tight hold every  time you portage. If you have an odd number of people in your party, using a sea  kayak may be a better option for the “odd one out” than attempting to  load a tandem canoe with three adults and camping gear. White water kayaks are  not suitable for the Canoe Circuit - they do not track well and have too little  stowage for camping gear.<br>\n<br>Both  canoes and sea kayaks are available for rent from the commercial lodges near the  park entrance.<br>\n<p></p>\n<strong>Canoeing Skills:</strong>\nPractice paddling along with the people you plan to do the Circuit.  All members of your party should be able to launch the canoe from shore, paddle  it consistently in a straight line, turn it in both directions and steer/sideslip  to avoid obstacles such as sweepers and deadheads in moving water. You should  know how to do a low brace to prevent capsize, and do a canoe over canoe rescue  if other group members capsize. If you plan to kayak, you should learn the equivalent  maneuvers, and be sure to practice “wet exits” – local pools may offer  practice sessions.\n<br>\n<br>You must know how to trim (balance) a canoe for the best paddling efficiency. The  load must be balanced from side to side and end to end. It is almost impossible  to steer if the bow (front end) is heavier, plowing through the water. On the  contrary, if the bow is too light it will catch wind, with the same end result.\n<br>\n<br>All these skills  are taught at local canoe clubs across North America. We strongly recommend that  you take lessons and practice your skills before arriving to paddle the Bowron  Lake Circuit.<br>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"https://www.bccanoe.com/trip-planning/canoe-safely\">Recreational Canoeing Association of British Columbia Canoe Safety</a>\n    <br>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<strong>Canoe Carts:</strong>\nOn portages,  you can avoid having to carry your canoe or kayak by renting a canoe cart, available  from the commercial outfitters near the park entrance. Even with a cart, it is  worthwhile learning how to lift and carry the canoe correctly. In order to reduce  damage to the trails caused by over-width and overweight canoe carts, the following  restrictions apply and will be enforced.\n<ul>\n  <li>Maximum axle width of canoe carts is 75 cm (30 inches)</li>\n  <li>If you use a cart, the weight of the cargo in the canoe/kayak must not exceed 28  kg (60 lbs)</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Backcountry Camping Skills:</strong>\nThe key to comfort and safety is knowing how to stay warm  and dry, even in a continuous downpour. There are facilities at Bowron Lake Park  that will help – four picnic shelters and six rustic cabins. These are for everyone's  use. You should plan to sleep in your own tent, using the cabins and shelters  for cooking and drying out wet clothes, and sharing the space with others. Not  all campsites have a shelter nearby.\n<br>\n<br>Ensure your tent and raingear are watertight before you leave – they may need to be seam-sealed.  Pack all your food and clothing in watertight containers. Specially designed portage  packs and dry bags are ideal, though garbage bags used as liners for nylon stuff  sacks work well, too.<br>\n<br>If you arrive in camp during a rainstorm, your first priority must be shelter. String  up a large tarp, and get your tent set up. Then change into dry clothing, and  cook up some warm food such as soup on your portable stove. Finally, work on starting  a fire. Look out for group members who are shivering, or just much quieter than  usual - they may have the early stages of hypothermia. Dry, warm clothing is a  priority for them.<br>\n<br>Remember to leave your campsite as clean as or cleaner than you found it. “Leave No  Trace”.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Food:</strong>\nIt is wise to plan each meal ahead of time: measure out the food, then double-bag  it to keep it dry. Pre-packaged, dehydrated dinners are recommended; canned food  is heavy to portage, and fresh food may not keep for the duration of the circuit.  Crackers, cheese, peanut butter, nuts, cookies, dried fruit and drink mixes make  a good lunch. Breakfast is a matter of taste, but please don't skip it. Remember  that you will probably be burning a lot more calories than you would at home,  so ensure the food is high-energy, delicious, and nutritious. Bring enough extra  food to last at least a couple of days in case you become storm-bound (or you  decide to take it easy – you're having such a good time.)\n<br>\n<br>Possession of commercially packaged beverages and all glassware is prohibited on the Canoe  Circuit. This includes beer and pop cans, bottles, jam jars and juice boxes. Use  reusable plastic water bottles.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Equipment:</strong>\nFor a complete equipment list as well as information about reservations and regulations,  please download the Bowron Lake Canoe Circuit Pre-trip Information Booklet:\n<a href=\"can_broch.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"legacy-link\">click here</a>.

Where are they?</em>\n<br>\nGrizzly bears have been seen at most locations around the Circuit.\n<br>\n<br>\n<em>What do you do if you meet a bear?</em>\n<br>\nStay calm, make noise, back away, leave the area.\n<a href=\"/plan-your-trip/visit-responsibly/wildlife-safety\">Click   here to view the Bear Safety at Bowron Lake web page</a>.\n<br>\n<br>\n<em>Will it attract bears if we make love in our tent?</em>\n<br>\nThere is no proof of this.<br>\n<br>\n<em>Will deodorant attract bears?</em>\n<br>\nYes, possibly. Bears are very curious and are attracted to unusual odours. Unfortunately,   it is best to leave your deodorant at home! Any items that you must   bring that have an odour (e.g. food, garbage, mosquito repellent)   must be stored in the bear-proof caches provided at all the campsites.<br>\n<br>\n<em>What are the bear-proof caches like?</em>\n<br>\nLarge metal boxes on the ground. Bears cannot open the doors because of the   recessed handles.<br>\n<br>\n<em>Is bear spray allowed on the circuit?</em>\n<br>\nYes. Please read the information on\n<a href=\"/plan-your-trip/visit-responsibly/wildlife-safety\">Bear   Safety at Bowron Lake Park</a>\nand follow all the recommendations   for safe travel and camping in bear country. Pepper spray is to   be used only as a last resort – do not let your guard down or assume   it will prevent bear encounters. If you bring pepper spray, carefully   read and follow the instructions provided by the manufacturer.\n<br>\n<br>\n<em>Is it safe for women to visit the park during their period - because of the   bears?</em>\n<br>\nBears have been attracted to menstruating women on very rare occasions. Use tampons   rather than pads to reduce odours.\n<br>\n<br>\n<em>What should women do with their tampons or pads?</em>\n<br>\nDispose of them in the pit toilets provided at all campsites.\n<p></p>\n<strong>\n  <a name=\"camping\" href=\"/\"></a>CAMPING</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\n<em>If you soap up, can you rinse off in the lake?</em>\n<br>\nNo. All washing of people or dishes should occur at least 50m back from the shore   to avoid polluting the lakes. This applies equally with biodegradable   soaps.\n<br>\n<br>\n<em>What do you do with your soapy wash water?</em>\n<br>\nPour it down the toilet hole.\n<br>\n<br>\n<em>Are campfires allowed?</em>\n<br>\nYes, in campsite fire rings only. You must bring a one-burner stove for cooking on,   however.\n<br>\n<br>\n<em>Where is the firewood located around the Circuit, and is it dry?</em>\n<br>\nYou will be given a map indicating woodlots; it is dry when cut into blocks,   but may be wet from rain.\n<br>\n<br>\n<em>What should we do with our garbage?</em>\n<br>\nCans: burn to eliminate odours, crush and carry out.\n<br>\nPaper: burn completely.\n<br>\nFoil and plastic: package in airtight bags and carry out. Do not   attempt to burn. Any unburnt garbage left in fire rings can attract   bears.\n<br>\n<br>\n<em>What size are the tent spaces?</em>\n<br>\nThey vary from 8' (1.5 m.) square to 12' (4 m) square.<br>\n<br>\n<em>Do the fire rings have grills on them?</em>\n<br>\nYes.<br>\n<br>\n<em>Are there picnic tables at all the campsites?</em>\n<br>\nNo.\n<br>\n<br>\n<em>Do we have to camp with other people?</em>\n<br>\nYes.

It is a   good alternative for less experienced paddlers or those who can   spare only two to four days.\n<br>\n<br>\n<em>How far apart are the canoe rests?</em>\n<br>\nApproximately 1/2 to 1 km apart.\n<br>\n<br>\n<em>What classification is the white water?</em>\n<br>\nThere is a high volume of moving water in the Isaac and Cariboo Rivers that can   be dangerous due to obstacles such as sweepers and deadheads. You   must know how to maneuver to avoid obstacles. Any white water of   class 2 or higher has a portage trail around it.\n<br>\n<br>\n<em>What hiking trails are there?</em>\n<br>\nOne to Harold Falls (1/2 km), one to Cariboo Falls (3 km), and one to Hunter Lake   (2 km).\n<p></p>\n<strong>\n  <a name=\"commercial\" href=\"/\"></a>COMMERCIAL SERVICES</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\n<em>Are there any canoe outfitters in the area?</em>\n<br>\n<strong>Any person acting as a guide or offering guiding services in Bowron Lake Park must hold a valid Park Use Permit (Park, Conservancy and Recreation Area Regulation, Section 4)</strong>. A link to companies that are authorized to conduct guided tours in the park can be found in the Special Regulations under the\n<strong>Know Before You Go\n</strong>section on the main Bowron Lake Provincial Park website.<br>\n<br>\n<em>Are there vehicle-access camping facilities?</em>\n<br>\nYes, the Bowron Park Provincial Park campground at the Registration Centre has 25   sites, and the two commercial lodges nearby also offer camping.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>\n  <a name=\"emergency\" href=\"/\"></a>EMERGENCIES AND COMMUNICATION</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\n<em>Do cellular phones work out there?</em>\n<br>\nNo.\n<br>\n<br>\n<em>What radio frequency do we use?</em>\n<br>\nYou are not authorized to use the park's radio frequencies.\n<br>\n<br>\n<em>What should we do in an emergency?</em>\n<br>\nSeek the help of other paddlers, reach 1 of 6 emergency radio phones (which are   located at strategic intervals around the Circuit) and call the   Registration Centre for instructions.\n<br>\n<br>\n<em>How long does it take for the Park Rangers to arrive in response to an emergency   call?</em>\n<br>\n2 hours to 1 day, depending on weather.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>\n  <a name=\"food\" href=\"/\"></a>FOOD</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\n<em>What should be packed for food?</em>\n<br>\nThis is a personal   preference. Check for commercially packaged lightweight food (dehydrated),   and remember to bring plenty of it - you'll be burning lots of calories.   Fresh food may not keep for the duration of the Circuit. Note: no   commercially packaged beverages are permitted.\n<br>\n<br>\n<em>Where should I buy food? Is there a store at the circuit?</em>\n<br>\nBuy food in your home town. That way you have time to measure out each meal   and pre-package it. There are two basic stores near the Registration   Centre for last minute supplies.\n<br>\n<br>\n<em>Can you drink the water? What type of filter do you need?</em>\n<br>\nTreat it before you drink it with a hand pump type filter that is rated for removal   of Giardia cysts, or boil it for 2 minutes.\n<br>\n<br>\n<em>Can I eat off the land?</em>\n<br>\nNo.\n<p></p>\n<strong>\n  <a name=\"gen_info\" href=\"/\"></a>GENERAL   INFORMATION</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\n<em>I have 8- &amp; 9-year-old children. Will they make it around the Canoe Circuit?</em>\n<br>\nYes, but you may end up doing the paddling for them. Make sure there are enough   strong paddlers in your group to allow for the kids.\n<br>\n<br>\n<em>Are we allowed to take dogs?</em>\n<br>\nNo.\n<br>\n<br>\n<em>Are we allowed to take firearms?</em>\n<br>\nNo.\n<br>\n<br>\n<em>Where do we leave our vehicle? Is it safe there? Is there enough room for   an RV? How much does it cost to park our vehicle?</em>\n<br>\nYou leave your vehicle in a free parking lot while paddling the Circuit; and there   is room for RVs.

      "content": "<a name=\"History\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"History\" href=\"/\"></a>History</h2>\n<p>\n  In 1959, the  Province of British Columbia purchased Mitlenatch from the Manson  family estate and in 1961 it was designated as a Provincial Nature  Park. Mitlenatch was once owned by the Manson family of Cortes  Island, who raised cattle and sheep on the island. Cattle were  butchered on the island and the meat rowed to Comox; sheep were  ferried to the island in spring and removed in late autumn. To  discourage “mutton pickers”, the family lived on the  island in a driftwood cabin during 1892. Today, nothing remains  of the Manson’s activities.\n</p>\n<a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>Cultural Heritage</h2>\n<p>\n  Mitlenatch  is an Indigenous word with a number of meanings. In Coast Salish  it has been translated to mean “calm waters all around”.  Perhaps the most descriptive meaning comes from the Sliammon  language where “metl” meant calm and “nach” meant  posterior. Calm (waters) behind is an apt description of the  island during stormy weather. To the Kwagiulth people “mah-kwee-lay-lah” meant “it  looks close, but seems to move away as you approach it”.\n</p>\n<a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>Conservation</h2>\n<p>\n  Rocky grassy  islands provide ideal nesting sites for seabirds and this park  is home to the largest nesting colony in the Strait of Georgia.  In addition to Glaucous-winged gulls, pelagic cormorants, pigeon  guillemots and black oystercatchers also  return to Mitlenatch each spring to breed. 3,000 pairs of Glaucous-winged  gulls choose to nest on Mitlenatch Island. This large pink-legged  gull with grey tips is the common seagull of Georgia Strait.  Adults start arriving in April to take up a breeding territory,  which will be held against all comers until early August when  their young depart. Eggs begin to appear around late May with  the first young hatching in late June. The incubation period,  from the time the last egg is laid, is 27 days.<br>\n  <br>Almost as soon  as the young hatch, they can move around. Instinctively they  peck at the red spot on their parent’s bill to induce feeding.  Adults will then regurgitate food as a warm partly-digested meal.  Everything from fish to garbage may be on the menu. For the patient  observer, this ritual can be watched from the bird blind. By  the end of August, most young gulls have left the island. Banding  studies indicate these grey-brown juveniles will winter within  100 kilometres of Mitlenatch.<br>\n  <br>The shallow  dry soils of Mitlenatch are not well-suited to trees. In the  meadow, strands of shore pine are expanding their hold. In the  upland area of West Hill a large strand of trembling aspen is  a rather unusual feature. This species is not at all common on  the coast but is very frequent in the British Columbia Interior.  Arbutus, Douglas fir, bitter cherry, Scouler’s willow,  black hawthorn and red alder are also present here.\n  <br>\n  <br>From late  April onwards, the parade of colourful flowers on Mitlenatch  is quite impressive. Blooming of many species continues as long  as sufficient moisture remains. Once the surface moisture is  used up these species quickly seed. Other plants like prickly  pear cactus, harvest brodiaea and gumweed, which have different  strategies for retaining moisture, then come into bloom.\n</p>\n<a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>Wildlife</h2>\n<p>\n  All sedentary  marine life, including abalones, scallops and sea cucumbers are  fully protected within this zone. Some of the largest garter  snakes in BC reside here. These harmless snakes may grow to more  than 90 cm (36 inches). They are often dark gray with black markings.  These snakes are frequently encountered along trails and in beach  and tide pool areas, where they feed on small fish such as sculpins  and blennies. This park is a favourite haul out for harbour seals,  Northern &amp; California sea lions. The sea lions are generally  present from late autumn to late spring. River otters, killer whales  and harbour porpoises are often sighted offshore.<br>\n  <br>Seabird colonies   are very sensitive to disturbance. The following “rules” must be   observed:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Visitors must stay on designated trails</li>\n  <li>Pets are not permitted on the island</li>\n  <li>When approaching the observation blind, KEEP THE PARTY TOGETHER  AND MOVE SLOWLY. This will reduce the gulls’ anxiety and allow  you to observe their behaviour and “family life” more easily.  Remain quiet while in the blind. If the blind is occupied,  please remain well back on the trail until the blind is vacated.</li>\n</ul>\nAt low tide, the rocky shores here provide the opportunity to view a very  wide variety of marine life. At least 12 species of starfish  have been found here, as well as animal types from sponges and  sea anemones to tunicates and small fish. The shallow bays and  eelgrass beds are rich in their variety of small fish with shiners,  pipefish, Staghorn, Sculpins, sand dabs and greenling being “common”.  Also at this time, one can view the phenomena of inter tidal  zonation. At various locations the white band of barnacles, followed  by a dark band with mussels, a band of green algae and at the lowest  portion of the beach – a brown band of seaweed are easily  seen. Tide pools, like small aquariums, provide excellent viewing  for sculpin, hermit crabs, anemones, crabs, a variety of shrimp,  small crustaceans and many other life forms.\n<p></p>",

It lies in   the transition zone between the wet coast and the dry interior.   These conditions provide a diverse range of plants and animal species   here.<br>\n  <br>Moisture-laden   air coming from the coast is pushed higher and higher into the Coast   Mountains. Cooling as it rises, the moisture in the air becomes   rain, or snow in the winter.<br>\n  <br>When the air   passes over the crest of the Coast Mountains, it warms up. Having   lost most of its moisture on the coastal side of the mountains,   it is much drier as it descends into the interior valleys. The average   rainfall in communities near Birkenhead Lake demonstrates this phenomenon.   Pemberton, on the wet side, gets an average of 92 cm, whereas Lillooet,   just a bit further inland, gets an average of 29 cm of precipitation   per year.<br>\n  <br>One of the mandates   of BC Parks is to preserve representative areas of different forest   types. A walk along the trail to the wilderness campsite on the   northwest side of the lake will take you through some wonderful   old-growth forest.

A small dam installed   by Ducks Unlimited at the lake’s outflow controls water levels.\n  <br>\n  <br>The park is   situated in the Interior Douglas-fir zone, a relatively dry climate   and features Douglas-fir trees with spruce and pines, and an understorey   of soopalallie and kinnikinick. Fields of grass dotted with aspen   trees surround the wetlands.<br>\n  <br>Bull thistle   is a noxious weed originating in Europe that has invaded Cariboo   Nature Park and was encroaching on the native bulrushes and sedges   that form important waterfowl habitat. In 1993, BC Parks instigated   biological control of the bull thistle by releasing an insect known   as the bull thistle seed head fly. This fly lays its eggs in the   flower bud of the thistle. As soon as the eggs hatch, the larvae   bore down into the base of the flower, which develops into a thick,   woody gall. The larvae over winter in the gall, emerging in the   spring. The result on the thistle is twofold: the seeds cannot develop,   and energy is used in growing the gall, weakening the rest of the   plant. As a result, the number of thistles near Woodfrog Lake has   been reduced substantially.\n</p>\n<a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>Wildlife</h2>\n<p>\n  Watch for a   wide variety of waterfowl, including goldeneye, bufflehead and Canada   geese.

Except for   aircraft, the sea is the only way there.</p>\n<p>The privilege   of enjoying this bit of paradise comes through the generosity and   foresight of James F. “Mac” Macdonald who first saw Princess Louisa   Inlet in 1919. Mr. Macdonald remembered the spectacular beauty of   the inlet as he travelled over the world. In 1926, after years of   prospecting in Nevada, “Mac” struck it rich. With his new found   riches, he was able to attain his real Eldorado: Princess Louise   Inlet. He obtained the land surrounding Chatterbox Falls in 1927   and build a log cabin that was tragically destroyed by fire in 1940.</p>\n<p>For years, “Mac”  acted as host to visiting yachtsmen and sailors. “This beautiful,   peaceful haven should never belong to one individual,” he said.   “I don't ever want it to be commercialized. Indians, trappers, loggers,   fishermen and yachtsmen have always been welcome to any hospitality   I had to offer. I have felt that I was only the custodian of the   property for Nature and it has been my duty to extend every courtesy.”</p>\n<p>In 1953, “Mac”   made the decision to turn the property over to the yachtsmen of   the Northwest. “In giving it to the boating public I feel as if   I am completing a trust. It is one of the most spectacular beauty   spots in the world,” he stated. “I am turning it over in perpetuity   as an international project so that you, your children, and your   children's children, ad infinitum, all may enjoy its peace and beauty   as God created it, unspoiled by the hand of man.”</p>\n<p>To maintain   the perpetual trust, the non-profit Princess Louisa International   Society was formed with an equal number of Canadian and American   trustees. The formation of this society ensured the preservation   of this enchantingly beautiful place for all future generations.</p>\n<p>\n  It was stipulated   that Mr. Macdonald would always have a place near Chatterbox Falls   to moor his houseboat. In 1972, his 83rd year, “Mac” spent his last   summer at the Inlet. He died in 1978.</p>\n<p>After ten years   of careful guardianship, the Princess Louisa International Society,   with the blessing of Mr. Macdonald, decided that for greater public   benefit, administration of the property should pass to the Government   of the Province of British Columbia. With the understanding that   all previous stipulations would remain in effect, the property became   Princess Louisa Provincial Marine Park in 1965. The Princess Louisa   International Society continues to play an active role in the conservation   and management of the park.</p>\n<p>It is your park   now, for you to enjoy. We are all its custodians. Your help and   cooperation in helping to preserve and maintain it is earnestly   sought. Please observe the courtesies of the sea whether afloat   or ashore. It is our responsibility to make sure that this magnificent   park remains as beautiful as it always has been.</p>\n<p>Today, over   half a century after “Mac” first saw this unique and lovely fjord,   people still come, many of them again and again, to thrill to its   new and ever changing beauty. A place where, as “Mac” said, “A person   can find the peace that passeth understanding.”</p>",

In  the late 1920s and early 1930s, De Courcy was the home of the  Aquarian Foundation founded by the infamous Brother XII, a man  described as “downright evil”, “The Great Beast” and  the “blackest man to have ever lived”. Brother XII  (aka Edward A. Wilson, among other names) was able to convince  up to 8,000 followers that he was the Twelfth Master of Wisdom  - part of a line of divine perfect masters from another world  who would teach his faithful the mysteries of ancient Egypt and  usher in a new age.<br>\n  <br>The amount  of money donated to the foundation is legendary - people would  give their entire life savings in support. The land purchased  included De Courcy Island. A settlement was built on the north  end of the island, with stories of having gun fortifications  and rock shelters. Any excess money was said to have been converted  to gold coins and sealed into glass jars and placed into cedar  chests. No one knows what happened to this fortune - perhaps  visitors to Pirates Cove (called Gospel Cove or The Haven in  Brother XII’s time) sail over it every time they arrive!

These routes are marked but not well-defined and should   only be attempted by experienced, well-equipped hikers with map-reading   and orienteering skills.<br>\n<br>\n<h3>Trails Into the Core Area</h3>\n<strong>Lakeview Trail Head to Core Area:</strong>\nThis 16-km trail, which includes an   elevation change of 1,300 metres, takes 6-8 hours. The trailhead   is at 13 km on the Ashnola Forest Service Road, 23 km from Highway   3. Lakeview Trail is the most direct route into the core area though   it is still considered difficult.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Wall   Creek Trail Head to Core Area:</strong>\nAt 20 km and an elevation change   of 1,100 metres, this trail takes 7-9 hours. The trailhead is at   38 km on the Ashnola Forest Service Road, 48 km from Highway 3.   A footbridge crosses the river. The footbridge is visible from the   road crossing the Ashnola River. This scenic trail follows the creek   up through open parkland forest and into Red Mountain Meadows.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Ewart Creek Trail Head to Core Area:</strong>\nThis trail is 28 km   in length and boasts an elevation change of 1,740 metres; hikers   can complete it in 10-12 hours, but many people turn it into an   overnighter by camping at Twin Buttes en route. The trailhead is   located at the confluence of Ewart Creek and the Ashnola River:   follow the Ashnola Forest Service Road roughly 6 km then turn left   onto Ewart Creek Road (a wooden Cathedral Lakes Lodge sign is posted   at the corner) and cross the Ashnola River bridge onto a single   vehicle road that follows the southside of the Ashnola River past   private cottages for 3 km until it reaches Ewart Creek Trailhead.   There is a pit toilet at the trailhead as well as an information   shelter and horse corral. This is the most challenging trail into   the Core Area. The first section of the trail is also used by horses   accessing Snowy Protected Area. Please respect these other users.<br>\n<br>\n<h3>Trails Within the Core Area</h3>\nLake is the hub from which trails and routes radiate to most of   the park’s scenic attractions. The approximate hiking times for   the trips listed below are for a round-trip. Most of these trails   are well-defined and some have improved walking surfaces. Distances,   elevation changes and walking times are all approximate. Please   stay on designated trails. Short-cutting and stepping off trail   to avoid wet areas increases erosion and destroys plant life and   soil structure. Due to the short growing season, these impacts take   years to rehabilitate.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Quiniscoe   Lake Trail:</strong>\nLength, 2 km. Suggested hiking time, 30 minutes.   An easy walk around the lake that passes a small waterfall.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Quiniscoe/Lake   of the Woods/Pyramid Loop Trail:</strong>\nLength, 2 km. Suggested hiking   time, 1 hour. 30 metre elevation change. Walking surface is improved   to hard-packed dirt, crowned to drain moisture and roughly three   feet wide. Milled lumber bridges and boardwalk are in place over   creeks and wet areas.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Quiniscoe   Lake to Lake of the Woods:</strong>\nLength, 1 km. Suggesting hiking time,   30 minutes, 30 metre elevation change.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Quiniscoe   Lake to Pyramid Lake:</strong>\nLength, 1 km. Suggested hiking time, 30   minutes. Minimal elevation change.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Scout   Lake Trail:</strong>\nLength, 3 km. Suggested hiking time, 1 hour. Elevation   change, 60 metres. A short detour from the Diamond Trail takes hikers   to this small lake.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Diamond   Trail around Scout Mountain:</strong>\nLength, 8 km. Suggested hiking   time, 4 hours. Elevation change, 250 metres. The trail winds up   through clusters of beautiful flowers and rock bluffs as well as   a small rock glacier where the rocks are slowly moving and pushing   into the soil. The Diamond Trail offers the best views of the Ashnola   Corridor.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Red   Mountain via Glacier Lake Trail to Centennial Trail:</strong>\nLength   10 km. Suggested hiking time 6 hours. Elevation change 250 metres.   This trail provides some of the best views in the park as hikers   scramble up through the open, mossy alpine. Hiking to the peak of   Red Mountain is not recommended for inexperience hikers.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Glacier   Lake Trail:</strong>\nLength, 3 km. Suggested hiking time, 90 minutes.   Elevation change, 200 metres. This trail is the quickest way into   the alpine and fairly steep. It is also one of the main access routes   to the Rim Trail.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Quiniscoe   Mountain via Glacier Lake Route:</strong>\nLength, 8 km. Suggested hiking   time, 5 hours. Elevation change, 500 metres. Above Glacier Lake,   this is a fairly easy well marked route. The plaque atop the mountain   is a positional marker once used to aid in mapping the area.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Stone City and Giant Cleft via Glacier Lake Routes:</strong>\nLength,   12 km. Suggested hiking time, 7-8 hours. Elevation change, 500 metres.   “Stone City” is a quartz monzonite formation eroded by   the action of wind over the millennia. The “Giant Cleft”   was formed when softer basalt rocks eroded, leaving a split in the   granite.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Ladyslipper   Lake Trail:</strong>\nLength, 7 km. Suggested hiking time, 3 hours. Elevation   change, 200 metres. The trail winds up through larch and spruce   trees offering great views of Grimface, the Matriarch and Macabre   Tower. Ladyslipper is the best spot for fishing.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Goat   Lakes Trail:</strong>\nLength, 10 km. Suggested hiking time, 4-5 hours.   Elevation change, 150 metres. This trail stays in the valley bottom,   following the outlet creek through wetlands and riparian vegetation,   making it a good choice for days when the weather is poor.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Lakeview   Mountain Trail:</strong>\nLength, 12 km. Suggested hiking time, 7-10 hours.   Elevation change, 600 metres. Lakeview Mountain is the highest point   in the park and, therefore, offers panoramic views of the park and   neighboring Snowy Protected Area.<br>\n<br>In   addition to the above hiking trails there are a number of cross-country   routes. These routes are unmarked and should only be attempted by   experienced, well-equipped hikers with map-reading and orienteering   skills.<br>\n<br>\nReturn to\n<a href=\"./\" class=\"legacy-link\">Cathedral Provincial Park</a>.",

Elevation change:  700 metres. This trail, which begins in the parking lot, follows  the northern lateral moraine of Bugaboo Glacier. The trail is very  steep and strenuous, with exposure to steep dropoffs as it climbs  through granite bluffs. Extreme caution should be exercised along  its route. Strong, reliable footwear is essential.</p>\n<h2>Cobalt Lake</h2>\n<p>Length one-way, 8.5km. Suggested hiking time, 2-4 hours. Elevation  change: 800 metres. This trail, which begins along the park access  road across from the CMH lodge, begins by climbing a series of  steep switchbacks up an old skid road, followed by a nice trail  through a forest of alpine larch trees. It eventually leads to  an open alpine ridge with good views to Cobalt Lake and the Bugaboo  Spires. To reach the lake, descend off the ridge to an alpine  pass and contour under Northpost Spire to below the waterfalls  draining Cobalt Lake. Bypass the waterfalls on the left to reach  the meadows surrounding the lake. Note that the last 2 km to  the lake requires routefinding skills as the trail is infrequently  marked. The un-marked alpine traverse route between Cobalt Lake  and the Conrad Kain Hut crosses talus slopes, snowfields, and  a small but crevassed glacier. It should only be attempted by  those with appropriate skills and experience.</p>\n<h2>Malloy Igloo</h2>\n<p>Length one-way, 13 km. Elevation change: 762 metres. This demanding  mountaineering excursion begins at the Conrad Kain Hut (which  is the starting point for many routes that lead to climbing destinations)  and terminates at the Malloy Igloo, a small shelter with no amenities  located near Osprey Peak. Only roped parties should attempt this  route because several glaciers have to be crossed. Alternatively,  access to the Malloy Igloo via Malloy Creek is also possible.  For groups of mixed experience it poses several obstacles. It  is recommended that you stay on the east side of the creek due  to two formidable stream crossings, and gain access via a small,  steep gully from which the crest of the moraine can be reached.  The final headwall is easier in early summer (lots of snow),  but may require roped climbing later in the season.</p>",

In 1972, the Alpine Club of Canada erected  a three story quonset building for climbers. The Conrad Kain Hut  was named after renowned alpinist who made many first ascents during  the early 1900’s in the Purcell and Rocky Mountains. In 1995,  the park and part of the surrounding recreation area were combined  to create the Bugaboo Provincial Park.<br>\n  <br>Over time the  erosive forces of mountain weather and glacial ice removed much  of the weaker  overlying rock revealing granite masses  and sculpting them into the spectacular spires that characterize  the Bugaboo region. The heavy snowfall of the “Columbia  Wet Belt” continues to create the vast glaciers that dominate  and shape the rugged Purcell Mountains.<br>\n  <br>The steep V-shaped  valleys of the Purcells challenged early explorers, miners, loggers  and  climbers from Europe and North America. News  of the spectacular spires of the Bugaboos were a magnet for  some of North America’s most renowned mountaineers. Harmon,  Longstaff, A.O. Wheeler and the legendary guide Conrad Kain  visited the Bugaboo  region in 1910. Kain returned with the MacCarthys in 1916 and  climbed the North Howser “Tower” and the south ridge  of Bugaboo Spire, which he considered his most difficult Canadian  ascent.  Thorington mapped the area and then climbed with Kain in 1933  on Crescent Spire. In 1938 and 1939 the Northpost, Eastpost  and Brenta  Spires were ascended by easy routes. Snowpatch, beyond the  techniques used in Kain’s era, was climbed by its southeast  ridge in 1940 by Arnold and Bedayn. By the 1950s climbers such  as Fred  Beckey,  Ed Cooper and Layton Kor put up the first “face” routes  on Snowpatch, Bugaboo and Pigeon Spires. Chouinard traversed  the Howsers in 1965 and Chris Jones pioneered on their 600-metre  ascent  of West Face in 1970.<br>\n  <br>Today those  early routes, first done with many pitons and bolts, are often  repeated by “free climbers” who  use only the less damaging aluminium chocks for protection  against falls. Free-climbing  techniques enable faster ascents, resulting in reduced exposure  to the frequent lightning storms; modern climbers have continually  opened new lines of ascent in an area where the elements of  glaciers, firm rock, significant altitude and violent weather  all combine  to create world-class mountaineering challenges.\n</p>\n<a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>Cultural Heritage</h2>\n<p></p>\n<a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>Conservation</h2>\n<p>Alpine ecosystems  are particularly fragile, and all users are requested to practice  no trace camping and climbing techniques.

      "content": "<a name=\"History\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"History\" href=\"/\"></a>History</h2>\n<p>\n  The park’s characteristically   rolling landscape was formed by debris left long ago by glaciers.   The glacial eskers here are remnants of the last ice age; the melting   of glaciers about ten thousand years ago left a hummocky landscape   partially filled with small lakes and ponds. Eskers are formed when   melt-water rivers transport gravel and silt underneath glaciers.   Tunnels near the base of retreating glaciers fill with transported   sediments that remain as sandy or gravelly ridges as the glacier   melts away.<br>\n  <br>The area has   been witness to much of the region’s history. The first people to   occupy the plateau were the Salish First Nations; they lived by hunting,   fishing, and gathering edible plants. For most of the year the group   was nomadic, spending the warmer months scouring the countryside   for food. Winter villages, however, were semi-permanent. The Salish   nomadic way of life did not survive the influx of settlers.   For the last 100 years, the area has been used for cattle ranching.\n</p>\n<a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>Cultural Heritage</h2>\n<p></p>\n<a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>Conservation</h2>\n<p>\n  Big Bar Lake   Park includes representative ecosystems in both forest and lakeshore   environments. The unique terrain imprints a snapshot of history   on the landscape, telling the story of the area’s history of glaciation.   The protection of such a landscape for its historical attributes   and aesthetic appeal is important. Equally important is the conservation   of the area’s wildlife habitat and plant and animal species. The   scattered lakes, ponds, and wetlands support a host of wildlife   species including large and small mammals, birds, and amphibians.   Additionally, lakes in the area support healthy populations of rainbow   trout.<br>\n  <br>The area’s dry,   warm summers and winters with moderate snowfall greatly influence   the plant species and wildlife species present. Since the park is   away from the moderating influence of the ocean, the temperature   extremes that must be tolerated by plant and animal life are greater   than at the coast. Both the grass and tree species found in the   area are uniquely adapted to this climate. Grasses grow quickly   in spring and use the moisture from snowmelt and rain, while seeds   and roots lie dormant during the summer’s hot and dry spell. Similarly,   tree species are characteristically deep-rooted in order to access   water. Common tree species include pine, spruce, and aspen – all   of which are well adapted to dry areas and re-establish quickly   following fire.<br>\n  <br>Flowers,   trees and shrubs are part of the park’s natural heritage, please   don’t damage or remove them.\n</p>\n<a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>Wildlife</h2>\n<p>\n  The   combination of grasses and trees with little undergrowth favours   certain kinds of animals. In particular, deer are drawn to grazing   areas closely interspersed with shelter in the trees. Coyotes, hawks   and eagles are also common and prey on field mice and voles inhabiting   grassland areas. Squirrels are plentiful, feeding on abundant pine   and spruce cones. Black bear, moose, lynx and cougar are some of   the large mammals found in the park and surrounding area. Park visitors   also often see snowshoe hares, chipmunks and marmots. Big Bar Lake   also supports an active beaver population. Please enjoy the beavers   and other wildlife through quiet observation without disturbance.<br>\n  <br>Ducks Unlimited built a water control structure at the end of the   marsh in 1988 to help encourage waterfowl nesting. There is excellent   birdwatching here. Fishing for rainbow trout is a popular activity   – the lake is stocked on a yearly basis.\n</p>",

Only minutes away in Fort St. James you can visit\n  <a href=\"http://www.pc.gc.ca/fra/lhn-nhs/bc/stjames.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Fort   St. James National Historic Site</a>. This fully restored Hudson’s   Bay Company Post commemorates the partnership between the fur traders   and First Nations People. It is the largest group of original wooden   buildings representing the fur trade in Canada. The Stuart Lake   Post was founded in 1806 because of the fur trade. Through the 1800s,   the area went through several phases with the arrival of the Hudson’s   Bay Company in 1821, the changing of its name to Fort St. James   in 1822, and the settlement saw its importance as a fur trading   centre diminish in 1869 when gold was discovered 100 miles north   in the Omineca Valley. With the miners came a new role and economic   prosperity for Fort St. James and it remained a hub of activity   into the 1900s. Today the area is driven by forestry and tourism.\n  <br>\n  <br>Upon arrival   you will receive a warm welcome at the modern visitor centre where   you can watch a presentation in the theatre, roam around the display   room and step back in time with a walk out to the old Hudson’s Bay   Company Post. Here you will meet costumed interpreters working in   the garden, see Carrier people practising ancient arts such as canoe   building, hide tanning and the drying and smoking of salmon. Before   heading home, relax and enjoy a snack or lunch at the Old Fort Cafe,   an open-air log building with picnic tables.<br>\n  <br>\n  The Indigenous name   for the site of present-day Fort St. James is Na-’Kra-ztli which   means “arrows floating by”. Although settled by Europeans almost   200 years ago (Fort St. James is said to be the oldest established   community in British Columbia) Indigenous peoples had inhabited the   area for years prior. These people became known as the “Carrier”,   referring to the custom of widows who carried the ashes of cremated   husbands on their backs until a traditional potlach could be held.<br>\n  <br>Another site   of historical interest is Our Lady of Good Hope Church. It was built   in 1878, is the third oldest church in the province, and remained   in regular use until 1951. Visitors can still attend a weekly mass   at the historic church in the summer months.\n</p>\n<a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>Cultural Heritage</h2>\n<p></p>\n<a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>Conservation</h2>\n<p>Stuart   Lake, one of the largest natural lakes in the province at about 70   kilometres long, is the southernmost in a chain of three lakes. The   Stuart-Takla chain includes Stuart Lake, the Tachie River, Trembleur   Lake, the Middle River, which has been designated a Provincial Heritage   River, and finally the remote and spectacular Takla Lake. Takla is   the fifth largest natural lake in the province at close to 90 kilometres   in length. Stuart Lake is drained by the Stuart River which joins   the Nechako River near Vanderhoof. The Nechako connects to the main   body of the Fraser River in Prince George. The Stuart-Takla river   system produces provincially significant salmon runs of sockeye and   chinook. This lake system also provides excellent fishing for rainbow   trout, lake char, dolly varden, and kokanee.</p>\n<a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>Wildlife</h2>\n<p>\n  The diverse   terrain and vegetation types in the Fort St. James area maintains   abundant wildlife. Moose and black bear are plentiful. Other lesser-seen   species include mule and white-tail deer, wolf, and grizzly bear.   Furbearers include the lynx, beaver, mink, marten, fisher, otter   and wolverine.\n</p>",

From the 1472 metre summit the panoramic view of Fort St.   James, Stuart Lake, and the snow-capped Omineca Mountains to the   north is unbeatable. Although the first part is relatively steep   (climbing 300 metres in elevation), the overall slope is roughly   13% with periodic viewpoints along the way. The entire elevation   gain of the six-kilometre trail is 791 metres. Allow four to six   hours for the return trip.\n<br>\n<br>The original   trail was first established by the Carrier Indians. The local band   would keep sentries on the mountain to watch the north end of Stuart   Lake for war parties coming down from Babine Lake. According to   Carrier legend a tribe of little people once lived in the mountain.   After killing them all off in a war, the Carrier would offer gifts   of salmon to the ghosts of the little people to ensure abundant   salmon runs would continue.\n<br>\n<br>The mountain   is named after Major Franklin L Pope. In 1865, while surveying a   route for the Overland Telegraph to Siberia, Pope was separated   from his Carrier guides and spent the night alone on the mountain.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Tulle Lake</strong>:   Another interesting hike in the Fort St. James area is the Tulle   Lake trail network featuring 15 kilometres of interconnecting trail   to three lakes with good fishing and wildlife viewing opportunities.   For the extremely energetic hiker with extra time to spend the historic   Nautley/Sowchea Pack Trail intersects the Tulle Lake trail system.   This 45 kilometre trail was used for generations as an early trade   route between villages on Fraser and Stuart lakes.\n<br>\n<br>The relative   flat of the Nechako Plateau gives way to the rolling hills around   Fort St. James. Mount Pope (1472 metres) overlooks Stuart Lake to   the west and signals the beginning of the Omineca Mountains rising   to the north.\n<br>\n<br>Return to\n<a href=\"./\" class=\"legacy-link\">Paarens Beach Provincial Park</a>",

This route avoids a long, strenuous climb up Chakima Valley.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Length   and Time Required:</strong>\n<br>\nThe route will vary in length as you choose your route across the plateaus, but is approximately 70 km in length from Buckley Lake to Mowdade Lake. We recommend a minimum of 7 days to hike this route, generally covering 10-15 km per day. Remember to consider additional time if planning on using the Klastline River Trail access routes.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Route Description:\n</strong>\n<br>\nElevation gain from Buckley Lake to treeline is a gradual climb. The trail is relatively flat across the plateaus, and cones and ridges are excellent landmarks in good visibility conditions.The terrain becomes more challenging at the Taweh Creek crossing and beyond Cocoa and Coffee Craters to the Chakima Creek Valley. Climate and weather can change extremely fast in this area, especially up on the alpine plateaus. Visitors must be prepared for all weather conditions at any time of the year. Most of the route is marked by cairns- respect these trail markings and do not build unnecessary cairns. Binoculars are recommended for routefinding cairn to cairn.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Please note:</strong>\n<br>\nA guide outfitter camp is located adjacent to the BC Parks Buckley Lake Camp. Please do not use tent poles or corral poles leaning in nearby trees for firewood. All campsites are user-maintained so pack out what you pack in.\n<br>\n<br>Upon leaving Buckley Lake Camp the trail leads 1 km downstream along Buckley Creek before crossing a log bridge. The trail then climbs gradually towards the Edziza Plateau, passing through intermittent wet sections and sub-alpine fir and pine to eventually parallel an old lava flow originating from Eve Cone. Sidas Cone will come into view here, the first of many volcanic cinder cones along this route. Scrub birch becomes the dominant vegetation and just as the edge of tree-line is reached you will see the first camp, known as the \"Willie Williams\" camp. Drinking water can be found here as well as moderate protection from the elements. This is a guide outfitter camp; do not use or burn poles or pieces of the camp.\n<br>\n<br>From \"Willie Williams\" camp, the route leads above tree-line and continues to do so until the Elwyn Creek valley is reached. The trail continues to follow the lava flow edge from Sidas Cone to pass by Eve Cone. Eve Cone is famous for its dark colour, impressive size, and perfectly geometric crater rim. BC Parks requests your cooperation in keeping trail use to the one main trail up Eve Cone (if you decide you must climb to the crater rim) as other trails leading up the crater have scarred the dark coloured sides. The main trail is located on the southeast side and leads to a small bench on the northeast side.\n<br>\n<p></p>\nPlease note: Water is scarce from Willie’s Camp to the Oasis and from the Oasis to Tsekone Ridge. Please ensure you fill up your water bottles prior to passing through these areas. The “Oasis” is located at GR 0311 on map 104G 15E\n<br>\n<br>\nAfter passing Eve Cone, visibility becomes unlimited as you start across broad plateaus with the summit icecap of Mount Edziza above. Approximately 3.5 km from Eve Cone, the route crosses a narrow pass between Tsekone Ridge and Pillow Ridge. The route then descends onto another vast plateau. The plateaus are covered by a thin layer of lichen, moss, and grasses until you reach branches of the Elwyn Creek. There are 2 crossings over branches of Elwyn Creek. This is an exceptional place to see Osborn caribou as visibility (unless hampered by weather) is at a premium. From Tsekone Ridge, the route follows a series of rock cairns, which can be seen from one cairn to the next, especially with the aid of binoculars. There are several creek crossings along this route and a pair of lightweight sandals is invaluable. Creek crossings may require some scouting to find the best route at varying times of the season, depending on water levels. Usually, the best crossing locations are marked with cairns, but caution should always be used and you may decide to wait until early morning to cross.<br>\n<br>After crossing the northern branches of Taweh Creek, the route twists and winds its way back through spectacular volcanic landforms, passing through valleys filled with white, black and red pumice rock to arrive at a high pass – views of Cocoa and Coffee Crater should be visible.\n<strong>Caution: This pass should not be undertaken in severe weather. Caution must be exercised while choosing a route over the toe of the ancient remnants of Tencho Glacier, as it is covered in a deep layer of pumice rock and sand, which is subject to collapse as the glacier below recedes or becomes unstable.</strong>\nThis section of the route is completely devoid of vegetation. Next, the route descends to pass by Coffee Crater and over vast fields and bizarre lava forms. Obsidian may be found along this section of the route and visitors are reminded that it is prohibited to remove these pieces and other items from provincial parks. Please take photographs only.<br>\n<br>Soon, the route climbs up and over a shoulder near Cartoona Peak and crosses a very flat, open expanse covered once again by ground vegetation. Another descent, marked by cairns, will cross a medium-sized creek (northern branches of Walkout Creek) to head up a narrow valley, ascending into Chakima Pass. From this location, Kakiddi Lake is visible (depending on weather conditions). The route then descends moderately into sub-alpine fir and wildflower meadows. There are no cairns after Chakima Pass, but the route is clearly visible. There is a guide outfitter camp approximately 1/3 of the way down the valley which has good drinking water, a fire ring, a table, a bench, and a few tent pad areas. As with the other camps, be respectful of these items. The route continues to descend, paralleling Chakima Creek, with 3 creek crossings to arrive at the pine and aspen flats approximately 2 km from Mowdade Lake camp. The creek crossings can be difficult in high water, and hikers need to be prepared for these crossings. For the last kilometre or so, Chakima Creek has braided and some branches of the creek follow the trail bed so soggy feet should be expected! Once you arrive at Mowdade Lake you will find tent pad areas, a dock, a fire ring, a pit toilet, and a bear-proof metal food cache available for public use.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Transportation   to Buckley or Mowdade Lake</strong>: A list of permitted air   charter companies is provided on the\n<a href=\"https://bcparks.ca/explore/parkpgs/mt_edziza\" class=\"legacy-link\">Mt.

Suggested hiking time, 1.5-2   hours. Elevation change: 212 metres. This is a very easy hiking   trail, and is especially suited for families with small children.   There is a good walking surface, with occasional wet spots. The   trail passes through cool, dense forest, along a riverside, and   past slide areas to Sayles meadow. By crossing the creek at this   point, one can return to the parking lot via the horse trail. All   along this hike there are flowers blooming at different times in   summer and a variety of fungi and mushrooms. Another feature of   interest that is found along the horse/ski trail is Crazy River   and Crazy Creek, both of which bubble out of the ground. They result   from the subterranean drainage of a portion of the karst plateau   which comprises most of the park.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Fish Lake to Coyote Creek Campsite and the Sugarloaf:</strong>\n  Length, 7   km. Suggested hiking time, 1.5-3 hours. Elevation change: 368 metres.   This is a fairly strenuous hike. It starts approximately 100 metres   north of Fish Lake and is clearly signed. The trail branches left   to Sugarloaf at km 5.6. The main trail continues to Coyote Creek   Campsite.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Lakeshore Trail:</strong>\n  Length, 2 km. Suggested hiking time, 30 minutes   to one hour. This is a pleasant stroll around Fish Lake, offering   many different views of the lake and the surrounding peaks.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Fish Laketo Summer Pass:</strong>\n  Length, 4 km. Suggested hiking time, 2-4 hours.   Elevation change: 430 metres. The trail begins at the north end   of Fish Lake via Lakeshore Trail, continuing through alpine meadows   to Summer Pass.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Fish Lake to Wildhorse Ridge:</strong>\n  Length, 3.2 km. Suggested hiking time, 2-4   hours. Elevation change: 640 metres. The trail begins at the bottom   of the slide to the west of Fish Lake. On the north side of the   creek the trail switchbacks steeply for about 20 minutes, then levels   out to follow the creek. The trail then encounters a small ravine   and rock slide. Past the ravine, the trail switchbacks up the south-facing   slope. The ridge offers a fine view of Mount Doolan and Dolomite   Lake. It's uphill all the way, but the scenery and alpine flowers   make it worthwhile.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Fish Lake to Sparkle Lake:</strong>\n  Length, 2.8 km. Suggested hiking time, 1-2   hours. Elevation change: 350 metres. The trail follows the first   section of the trail to Wildhorse Ridge. At the top of the first   steep pitch, it branches and crosses the creek. Follow the trail   through the trees to a rock slide. Traverse the western edge and   slowly gain elevation until the top southern edge is reached. Proceed   through a small band of trees to a large slide path. The trail stops   here. Sparkle Lake is directly ahead at this point. Please walk   on the rocks to prevent damage to moss and meadows. From the lake,   two ridges give spectacular viewpoints. Overnight camping is not   permitted at Sparkle Lake.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Fish Lake to Alpine Viewpoint:</strong>\n  Length, 3.2 km. Suggested hiking time,   2-3 hours. Elevation change: 600 metres. The trail starts approximately   100 metres north of Fish Lake and then is blocked by a large slide   path; the rest of the journey involves picking your way through   scree until attaining the ridge. Caution must be exercised while   ascending and descending the scree slope so that dislodged rocks   will not strike anyone climbing below. It is best to travel abreast   of or directly behind one another. This hike culminates with panoramic   views from the ridge of Fish Lake, Lussier Valley, the alpine meadows   and Mount Morro. Access to the meadows is easy. No camping is permitted   at the viewpoint.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Coyote Creek Campsite to Sugarloaf:</strong>\n  Suggested hiking time, 30 minutes.

Visitors should be equipped  for wet weather. High-topped leather or rubber boots should be  carried and proper hiking boots should be worn.</p>\n<p>Note that there  are sections of boardwalk on the trails, which can be extremely  slippery when wet. Hikers should always use caution. Distances  quoted for the trails are one-way only, and the approximate hiking  times are geared to travel in good weather. Hiking times in inclement  weather or when trails are muddy can be considerably longer.</p>\n<p>The need to  be prepared for adverse weather conditions in Cape Scott Provincial  Park cannot be overemphasized.</p>\n<p>A good tent with  a waterproof fly is imperative. It is simply not possible to  expect to sleep outdoors here without adequate cover. Clothing,  sleeping  bags and food should be kept in waterproof bags. A small primus-type  stove should be carried for cooking purposes since suitable firewood  is in short supply. Moleskin is a good preventative against blisters.  Proper raingear is a must, as torrential rains can be expected  at any time and may last for days on end. A basic first aid kit  should be carried and insect repellent is recommended.\n</p>\n<h3>Coastal Hiking Safety</h3>\n<p>Hiking along  the coastline is dangerous and not recommended unless following  designated beach routes. Rogue waves are common along all beach sections in this area.</p>\n<p>\n  When hiking along beach routes,  watch for suspended floats and buoys indicating access to trails.  No attempt should be made to traverse undesignated coastal areas  at high tide or when tides are flooding (incoming.)</p>\n<p>Knowledge of  the tides is essential for any visitor considering travel in the  coastal area. Wilderness camping is not restricted to particular  sites, although the more popular spots are near San Josef Bay and  Nels Bight. Fresh water is available from streams at these sites,  as well as at the east end of Nissen Bight and at Guise Bay. Boil,  filter or treat all drinking water before consuming.</p>\n<p>Camping sites  should be chosen carefully to prevent flooding from incoming tides,  contamination of drinking water sources and to minimize damage  to the environment.</p>\n<p>When walking  around old settlements, watch out for abandoned wells, broken  glass and rusty nails. Standing structures  are unstable.  Please do not remove artifacts or disturb sites.\n</p>\n<h3>Hiking and Camping Guidelines</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Backcountry Camping Fees apply.\n    </strong>Backcountry Camping Fee: $10.00 per adult / night (persons 16 years of age or older) Backcountry Camping Fee: $5.00 per child / night (persons 6 – 15 years of age).\n    <strong>Please pay in cash only</strong>\n    at the self-registration booths located at either trailhead.</li>\n  <li>Please practice “<a href=\"https://leavenotrace.ca/\">Leave No Trace</a>” ethics – pack out what you pack in.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Be Bear Aware</strong>.

Average  one way hiking time: 45 minutes. Less adventurous hikers can  leave the  backpack at home and still get a taste of Cape Scott's unique  terrain and spectacular Pacific Ocean vistas along this well-maintained  gravel trail, which ends at the sandy shore of San Josef Bay  in the southeastern corner of the park. Camping is allowed at San  Josef Bay.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Eric Lake:</strong>\n  Length 3 km from the trailhead. Average one  way hiking time: 1 hour. 11 tent pads, located in the forest,  are available on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Fisherman River:</strong>\n  Length 9.3  km from the trailhead. Average one-way hiking time: 3 hours.  This is a popular spot for a picnic or rest.  The river is also a good place to collect drinking water. Remember  to boil, filter or treat all drinking water before consuming.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Nissen Bight/Nels Bight Junction:</strong>\n  Length 13.1 km from the trailhead. Average one-way  hiking time: 4.5 hours. The trail forks here—go  straight ahead to Nissen Bight, or left to Nels Bight and Cape  Scott. This is a popular camping destination with a beautiful  sandy shoreline.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Nissen Bight:</strong>\n  Length 15 km from the trailhead. Average one-way  hiking time: 5.5 hours. This is a popular camping destination  with a beautiful sandy shoreline.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Hansen Lagoon:</strong>\n  Length  14.7 km from the trailhead. Average one-way hiking time: 5 hours.  More than 100 years ago this area was the  main settlement of the Danish pioneers, who grew crops and hay  here on the open meadows. Remnants of the past include fence-posts  along the old road and evidence of the early settler’s  drainage systems.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Nels Bight:</strong>\n  Length 16.8 km from the trailhead. Average  one-way hiking time: 6 hours. With a beautiful sandy beach stretching  more 2,400 metres long and 210 metres wide at low tide, Nels Bight  is the most popular camping destination in the park. This area  is also a good base for those exploring the rest of the park.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Experiment  Bight:</strong>\n  Length 18.9 km from the trailhead. Average  one-way hiking time: 7 hours. This area has a beautiful sandy beach,  however there is no year-round drinking water or facilities available.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Guise Bay:</strong>\n  Length 20.7 km from the trailhead. Average one-way  hiking time: 7.5 hours. Guise Bay is another beautiful beach that  offers good camping possibilities. Lucky visitors may sometimes spot  sea otters, an endangered species, in the bay.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Cape Scott:</strong>\n  Length 23.6 km from the trailhead. Average one-way  hiking time: 8.5 hours. The public may visit the lighthouse,  which is outside the provincial park and federally operated. The  Federal Government has removed the suspension bridges and closed all  public access between the lighthouse and foghorn at the Cape itself.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Sea Otter Cove and Lowrie Bay:</strong>\n  Length 10 km from the trailhead. Average one-way  hiking time: 5 hours. The route to Sea Otter  Cove is accessed via San Josef Bay’s second (western) beach.  From this point the route gains elevation quite quickly until you  reach  the summit of Mt. St. Patrick, which offers a spectacular panoramic  view of the park. From this point the route descends the mountain  to Sea Otter Cove. Sea Otter Cove is only passable at mid to  low tide. Only experienced hikers familiar with wilderness hiking  and the use of a map and compass should go beyond Mt. St. Patrick.  This route receives minimal or no regular maintenance.<br>\n  <a name=\"northCoastArea\" href=\"/\"></a>\n</p>\n<h2>North Coast Trail</h2>\n<p>The North Coast Trail is a 43.1km extension to the original Cape Scott trail. The total hiking distance is approximately 59.5km. The\n  <em>minimum</em>\n  recommended one way hiking time is 5 days; although, it is more commonly completed in 6 to 8 days. Hiking times are estimated for the average hiker in good physical condition in optimal weather conditions.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>This is a very challenging route and is not recommended for inexperienced hikers.\n  </strong>Many sections require hikers to climb over or along fallen trees, to cross through deep mud, and to use fixed ropes to climb up and over steep sections. It is not recommended for those with a fear of heights. Consider hiking sections of the Juan de Fuca Marine Trail or the Cape Scott Trail to Nels Bight prior to attempting a trip to the North Coast Trail.</p>\n<p>The trail is located in a wilderness area with minimal supplies or equipment of any kind. It is not regularly patrolled, so hikers should be completely self sufficient.\n  <strong>It is strongly recommended that all hikers carry a satellite phone or VHF radio in case of emergency.</strong>\n  Cell phones do not work in the park, and assistance may be days away in case of an accident.</p>\n<p>The trail runs along the northern end of Vancouver Island spanning Cape Scott Provincial Park. It can be traversed east to west from Shushartie Bay to the eastern end of Nissen Bight or in reverse from west to east. The trail becomes progressively easier in the east to west direction. Access to the Shushartie Bay trailhead is by boat or floatplane only. There are currently no docking facilities. One water taxi service runs from Port Hardy during the summer season. Access to the western portion of the trail is from the San Josef parking lot at the Cape Scott trailhead. Shuttle service to the parking lot can also be arranged in Port Hardy.</p>\n<p>The trail offers visitors a glimpse into wild, west coast ecosystems. The rugged trail passes through old and second growth Sitka spruce, hemlock and cedar forests, upland bogs, riparian areas, across sand, gravel and cobble beaches, and past sea stacks, rocky headlands, and tidal pools. The park is home to bald eagles, black bears, cougars, wolves, river and sea otters, mink, and an array of marine mammals. Sighting and encounters are common in the park, so visitors should use precaution.</p>\n<p>Cape Scott Provincial Park is rich with First Nations history. Many signs of their historic presence are evident in the park. Please respect all cultural sites and leave them in an undisturbed state. Do not touch or remove any cultural items.\n</p>\n<h3>Trail Overview</h3>\n<h4>\n  <strong>Shushartie Bay Campsite to Skinner Creek Campsite: 8.1km – 5 to 7 hours</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>This is the longest section of inland trail and is considered by most to be the most challenging portion of the entire oute. The trail reaches its maximum elevation of 225m along this section and passes mainly through upland bog ecosystems. This section provides sensitive habitats for amphibians, fish and invertebrates so please stay on the trail to avoid increased erosion and damage. There are stretches of boardwalk, but expect to be climbing up, over and around tree roots and stumps and through very muddy sections.</p>\n<p>Three tent pads, a food cache, and a pit toilet are located on the hillside above the trailhead at Shushartie Bay; however, there is no water source at Shushartie Bay. If you are hiking from Skinner Creek, fill up your water bottles there.</p>\n<p>There is a designated campsite at Skinner Creek with a pit toilet and food cache. There are no tent platforms but beach camping is possible.</p>\n<p>\n  Skinner Creek is the only good water source along this section of trail.\n  <br>\n</p>\n<h4>\n  <strong>Skinner Creek Campsite to Nahwitti River Campsite: 2.9km – 1 to 1.5 hours</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>It is possible to hike along the beach from Skinner Creek to Nahwitti River at low tide; however, this section can be very dangerous during high tides and can be virtually impassable. A rough inland trail can be used to bypass the beach if necessary. There is one section of inland trail to be used at all times. Hanging floats at the end of the beach identify the access point. Tide tables should be consulted before attempting to hike the beach section.</p>\n<p>There is a campsite with four tent platforms, a food cache, and a pit toilet located at Nahwitti River.</p>\n<p>The Nahwitti River can be used as a water source, but walk far enough upstream to avoid tidal influx.\n</p>\n<h4>\n  <strong>Nahwitti River Campsite to Cape Sutil Campsite: 5km – 2.5 to 4 hours</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>From the Nahwitti River camp the trail heads south on an easy trail to the first cable car crossing. The ladders to the cable car platforms are very steep and caution should be used especially in wet weather. No more than two people, or 600lbs, should use the cable car at one time.</p>\n<p>Portions of the next section of trail are through dense forest where the trail can easily be lost. Look for trail markers to identify the path. Be aware that some areas may have old flagging tape delineating old logging tracks and are not marking the trail.</p>\n<p>The trail then heads up and over what is known as Long Leg Hill before descending down the longest set of stairs in Cape Scott Provincial Park. The stairs are slippery when wet.</p>\n<p>The beach west of the Nahwitti stairs is impassable at high tide due to a rocky promontory. Wading past this section at high tide should not be attempted due to the risk of being swept out to sea.&nbsp; Plan your hike accordingly by consulting a current tide table. Camping at the eastern edge of the beach is possible during certain times of year if necessary. Ensure that you are set up well above the high tide line. There is a good water source located immediately east of the rocky promontory.</p>\n<p>The last stretch to the Cape Sutil campsite is characterized by steep, rugged headlands with extensive rope work. If necessary, remove your pack and lower it with the ropes provided. The section is very slippery and a fall will likely result in serious injury.</p>\n<p>Cape Sutil itself lies outside of the park boundary in an Indian Reserve. It is the former site of the First Nations village of “Nahwitti” and is rich in cultural heritage.&nbsp; Access to the reserve is restricted, so please refrain from visiting the Cape.</p>\n<p>There is a ranger yurt located at Cape Sutil that is staffed with Park Facility Operators (PFOs) from June 15th to Labour Day weekend. The yurt is open the rest of the year for emergency use by the public. Please ensure you leave the yurt in better condition than you found it. Do not wear caulk boots in the yurt, and use the food caches located behind the structure.</p>\n<p>Beach camping is possible at Cape Sutil (there are no tent platforms at this site).&nbsp;There is a pit toilet located 50 metres up the trail at the eastern end of the beach.&nbsp; There is a food cache located behind the ranger yurt and another one by the pit toilets.</p>\n<p>There are only ephemeral water sources along this section of trail. Pack water from Nahwitti River or Irony Creek (depending on direction of travel).\n  <br>\n</p>\n<h4>\n  <strong>Cape Sutil Campsite to Irony Creek Campsite (Shuttleworth Bight): 7.8km – 4 to 6 hours</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>Pocket beaches and rocky headlands characterize this section of trail. Keep your eyes open for floats and buoys hanging near inland trail access points. Many beach sections can be traversed at low tide, but look for the adjacent inland routes during high waters. More rope work and steep sections can be expected along this stretch.</p>\n<p>There is a creek ford immediately west of the Irony Creek campsite. Passage can be difficult under high flows (e.g. in early spring), and the rocks in the area are slippery at all times of year, in all weather conditions.</p>\n<p>There is a campsite located on the west side of Irony Creek in the middle of Shuttleworth Bight. There are four tent platforms, a food cache, and a pit toilet at this location.</p>\n<p>Irony Creek is the only good water source along this section of trail.\n  <br>\n</p>\n<h4>\n  <strong>Irony Creek (Shuttleworth Bight) Campsite to Laura Creek Campsite: 11.8km – 4 to 7 hours</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>This section is predominantly coastal. Hikers will find themselves exposed to the effects of the open ocean with little in the way of cover in inclement weather. Camping is possible along the pocket beaches northwest of the cable car but no facilities are provided. Consult tide tables to ensure high tides do not hinder progress along this section.</p>\n<p>There is a short, easy, inland section to the second cable car crossing located at the Stranby River. Look for signs of the old corduroy settler’s road on the west side of the cable car.</p>\n<p>Beach sections alternate between, sand, gravel and cobble while passing by innumerable tidal pools and rock shelves exposed at low tide. This section is teaming with wildlife. Bald eagles perched in old growth Sitka spruce, and black bears foraging in the beds of seaweed, are quite common.</p>\n<p>There is another creek ford east of the Laura Creek campsite. It is generally easy to cross, but rocks in this area are very slippery.</p>\n<p>There is a designated campsite with four tent platforms, a food cache, and a pit toilet located approximately 200 metres west of Laura Creek.</p>\n<p>Laura Creek is the only good water source along this section of trail.\n</p>\n<h4>\n  <strong>Laura Creek Campsite to Nissen Bight: 7.5km – 2.5 to 4 hours</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>This is the last section of inland trail before reaching the Nissen Bight trailhead. It begins and ends with easy sand beach walks before climbing back into the forest to traverse around the Nahwitti Cone. Boardwalks and stairways are common, but many sections are still very muddy. Look for the old settler’s road along this section, and stop for a break at Laughing Loon Lake – the North Coast Trail’s only lake (not suitable for swimming).</p>\n<p>There are three significant creek crossings along this section. The first and third (when heading east to west) have bridges with handrails, but the second, located at Dakota Creek, does not.\n  <strong>Do not attempt to walk across the log spanning the second creek.</strong>\n  It is very slippery and unsafe. Either ford the creek or shimmy across the log.</p>\n<p>Beach camping is possible on the entire length of Nissen Bight. A pit toilet and food cache are located at the western end of the beach, and another food cache at the eastern end.</p>\n<p>The water source is located at the eastern end of the beach near the North Coast Trail trailhead (approximately 900 metres from the pit toilet and food cache). At low tide walk approximately 50 metres east along the rocks, or at high tide take the inland trail which forks to the east off of the NCT near the beach.\n</p>\n<h4>\n  <strong>Nissen Bight to Cape Scott Trailhead: 15.4km – 5 to 7 hours</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>This section is part of the original Cape Scott Trail. It is the easiest section of the North Coast trail and also the most maintained. There are many boardwalk sections, but still expect to get your feet muddy. Look for remnants of the Danish settlers along the entire route.</p>\n<p>There is a campsite with three tent platforms and a pit toilet located at Fisherman River at kilometre 9.3 (from the Cape Scott trailhead). There is no food cache at this location.</p>\n<p>There are eight tent platforms, a food cache, and a pit toilet located at Eric Lake at kilometre 3 (from the Cape Scott trailhead). Access to the lake is on the west side of the campground.</p>\n<p>Fisherman River is the best water source along this section of trail.\n</p>",

      "content": "<a name=\"History\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"History\" href=\"/\"></a>History</h2>\n<p>\n  Cape Scott was named in 1786 in honour of David Scott, a Bombay merchant  who was one of the principal backers of a trading voyage to this  area. The naming was done by Captain Guise and Captain Lowrie  of, respectively, the Experiment and the Captain Cook. Remote  and inhospitable, the history of Cape Scott has been shaped by  its heavy rainfalls and violent windstorms.<br>\n  <br>Cultural buffs will appreciate the rich history of the area, which was first  inhabited by the Nahwitti people prior to white settlement.<br>\n  <br>\n</p>\n<h4>Danish Pioneers</h4>\nFrom 1897 to 1907 the first white settlement attempt was made at Cape Scott.   The settlers were Danes, mostly from Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska and   North Dakota; they were hoping to establish an ethnic community   around Hansen Lagoon and Fisherman Bay. The colony hoped to subsist   initially on fishing until the government followed through on its   agreement to build a road from Fisherman Bay to San Josef River   and on to Holberg. This road was to provide the link necessary so   that the settlers would be able to get their beef and dairy products   to market. Unfortunately the road never materialized. The colony   struggled to survive by fishing and trapping mink, river otter and   beaver for their pelts. Eventually the trapping petered out and   the men were forced to leave to fish at Rivers Inlet or to work   in mines or logging camps. By 1907, the settlers had acknowledged   the failure of their colony and plans were made for departure.Today, little remains  of the Danish settlement except the names - Nels Bight, Hansen  Lagoon, Frederiksen Point - and a few fragile buildings and  other man-made relics.<br>\n<br>The population of the area between Cape Scott and Holberg numbered less than 60   in 1909. By 1913, another wave of settlers had arrived from Washington   State, the prairie provinces, Eastern Canada and Europe to occupy   land available for pre-emption. Many of these settlers established   themselves in homes vacated by the Danes near Hansen Lagoon. Others   took up land and built homes at Fisherman Bay and San Josef Bay.   The population of the second settlement peaked at over 1,000, then   began a slow decline as the new residents encountered the same hardships   as the Danes had experienced. Conscription in 1917 for service in   the First World War brought an end to this second community and   soon Cape Scott was virtually deserted again.\n<br>\n<br>Requirements of national security during the Second World War led to the construction  of a small radar station at Cape Scott in 1942,  which remained in operation until 1945. Today, remnants  of human activity can be seen throughout Cape Scott Provincial  Park. Please be careful when exploring historic sites. Rusting tools  and implements, dilapidated buildings and old wells can be hazardous.  Please do not remove artifacts or disturb sites.\n<p></p>\n<a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>Cultural   Heritage</h2>\n<p>\n  Three native peoples - the Tlatlasikwala, Nakumgilisala and Yutlinuk  - shared the Cape Scott area prior to white settlement. The Yutlinuk  of the Scott Islands died out in the early 1800s. The Nakumgilisala  and Tlatlasikwala amalgamated in the mid-1850s and moved to Hope  Island, where they remained until 1954. That year, numbering only  32, they joined with the Koskimo people and moved to Quatsino Sound.  Today they are known collectively as the Nahwitti. They have six  reserves, three of which are within the boundaries of Cape Scott  Provincial Park.\n</p>\n<a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>Conservation</h2>\n<p>\n  Upland areas of the park are forested with red and yellow cedar,  lodge pole pine, hemlock and true fir. The rugged coastline of  the park is dominated by concentrations of old-growth Sitka spruce  A thick undergrowth is made up mostly of salal, salmonberry, evergreen  huckleberry and fern. The highest point in Cape Scott Provincial  Park is Mt. St. Patrick, which rises 422 metres above sea level.  Eric Lake, at 44 hectares, is the largest body of fresh water.\n</p>\n<a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>Wildlife</h2>\n<p>\n  Hansen Lagoon is a stopping place for Canada geese and a variety  of wildfowl traveling the Pacific Flyway. The ubiquitous gull and  other sea birds frequent the shoreline. Coastal black-tailed deer,  Roosevelt elk, black bears, cougars and wolves are found in the  forested and open uplands. Seals, sea lions, sea otters, killer  whales and gray whales all inhabit the waters offshore. Visitors  to San Josef Bay will often see river otters and mink in the river  and estuary, as well as Canada geese, common merganser and, in  the winter, Trumpeter swans.\n</p>",

A playground, horseshoe pitches and a picnic shelter with   wood stove are located within the campground. Water, toilets and   firewood are provided. Two sandy beaches that are suitable for the   entire family are located along the Beach Trail; these are about   20 minutes and 40 minutes from the campground.\n<strong>No lifeguard is   on duty.</strong>\nThere are 12 more campsites near the east end of War   Lake, although these are not suitable for long units. Water, toilets,   firewood and a car-top boat launch are provided.\n<br>\n<br>\nAlthough the   park has the aforementioned “family” amenities, most of Carp Lake’s   visitors are interested primarily in angling and water-oriented   activities in a wilderness setting. The lake, with its many islands,   bays and coves, lends itself to exploration by boat or canoe. Three   of the islands with which the Carp Lake is dotted, Balsam Island,   White Spruce Island and Spirea Island have so-called “wilderness”  campgrounds. These primitive sites are user-maintained, which means   that campers are expected to haul all their garbage back to the   boat launch for disposal. Developments in the park are rudimentary,   and only those who are completely self-sufficient should plan on   visiting. Other than water and firewood there are no supplies of   any kind, and the nearest settlement, McLeod Lake, is 32 kilometres   to the northeast.\n<br>\n<br>A boat-launching   ramp is located near the campground. It is capable of handling standard   boat trailers but caution should be exercised. After launching a   boat, please return your trailers and towing vehicles to the campground   before going boating. Both power boating and canoeing can be an   enjoyable pastime on Carp Lake, provided reasonable care is practiced.   The lake is subject to high winds and the resulting rough waters   can swamp the boats of anyone who is unwary. Watch the weather and   observe common-sense boating practices. Always wear life-jackets.\n<br>\n<br>Power boat operators   are requested to please reduce speed in Kettle Bay to prevent damage   to boats and equipment and to reduce erosion of the lakeshore. The   launching of personal watercraft or boats with above-water unmuffled   exhausts is not permitted in Carp Lake Provincial Park.",

Anglers come from near and far to try their luck with fly or spinner   for the lake’s succulent rainbow trout.\n<br>\n<br>The Carp Lake  watershed above War Falls has isolated six fish species from  the Peace River drainage. Rainbow trout averaging 500 grams and  burbot are regularly caught by anglers. Northern Pikeminnow,  two species of suckers and redside shiners can be found in park  waters. There is also a short loop trail that connects Carp Lake  Campground with the McLeod River, providing access to fly fishing  sites.\n<br>\n<br>The Carp Lake   fishery depends solely on natural reproduction. There is no stocking   program. With increasing demand on the fishery, the catch and release   program is encouraged.

Carrier peoples of the area went   to the lake to “catch immense numbers of fish of the carp kind,”   according to the journals of the great explorer, Simon Fraser, who   penned his comments in 1806 while he was at nearby Fort McLeod.   It was the fish of Carp Lake that provided sustenance for Fraser   and his followers at the fort when nearby McLeod Lake failed to   keep them supplied; only a few fish could be caught in McLeod Lake   because, as Fraser reported, “the water was too high.”<br>\n  <br>The Carp Lake   region has played a significant role in the history of British Columbia.   In 1805 Simon Fraser, while in the employ of the Northwest Company,   founded Trout Lake Fort at McLeod Lake, 32 kilometres northeast   of Carp Lake. Later renamed Fort McLeod, it was the first permanent   white settlement west of the Rocky Mountains in what is now British   Columbia. In 1806, Fraser journeyed south and west from Fort McLeod   to Stuart Lake, where he built Fort St. James and established a   lucrative fur trade with the Carrier peoples. A trail, long used   by First Nations and soon to become an important route for the fur traders,   connected Stuart Lake with McLeod Lake by way of Carp Lake. Remnants   of this historical trail remain along the north and west sides of   Carp Lake.\n</p>\n<a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>Cultural Heritage</h2>\n<p></p>\n<a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>Conservation</h2>\n<p>\n  Carp   Lake sits at an elevation of 841 metres on the Nechako Plateau, about   100 kilometres northwest of Prince George.

Suggested hiking time, 20 minutes. No elevation change.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Lower Elk Lake to Upper Elk Lake:</strong>\n  Distance, 1 km. Suggested hiking time, 20 minutes. Elevation change: 30 metres. This hike brings you to the north end of Upper Elk Lake and Fox Lake Trail Junction.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>\n    <strong>Viewpoint Trail</strong>:</strong>\n  Distance, 1.2 km. Suggested hiking time, 1-1.5 hours return. Elevation change, 122 metres. The trail begins on the west side of Upper Elk River where it enters Lower Elk Lake. It skirts the lakeside, then climbs steeply to a prominent viewpoint. Trail is short but strenuous and does travel above steep cliffs.\n  <em>\n    <strong>Stay well back from the edge, and use extreme caution with children.</strong>\n  </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Upper Elk Lake to Petain Creek Waterfal</strong>l: Distance, 3 km. Suggested hiking time, 1-1.5 hours. Elevation change: 30 metres. This is an easy hike, and it rewards the visitor with beautiful views of the Petain Creek waterfall and the Castelnau Hanging Glacier. It passes through an area immediately West of Upper Elk Lake that becomes a route for 500 metres most early summers due to flooding.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Elk Lakes Trailhead to West Elk Pass Trailhead:</strong>\n  Distance, 4 km. Suggested hiking time, 1-1.5 hours. Elevation gain, 240 metres. The trail starts near the Public Cabin and heads north towards the provincial boundary between Elk Lakes Park and Peter Lougheed Park. At this point hikers can complete a loop via Fox Lake Trail to Upper Elk Lake (see next write-up).</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Fox Lake Trail:</strong>\n  Distance, 3.9 km. Suggested hiking time, 1.5-2 hours. Elevation change, 250 metres. The trail climbs from Upper Elk Lake, crossing several open avalanche chutes that offer scenic views of Elk Valley and Neville Basin. It then continues past Fox Lake and joins the West Elk Pass Trailhead.\n  <em>\n    <strong>This route is not recommended for winter travel due to avalanche hazard.</strong>\n  </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Elk Pass Trail (Peter Lougheed Provincial Park):</strong>\n  Distance, 5 km. Suggested hiking time, 1-1.5 hours. Elevation gain: 250 metres. The trail starts at Elk Pass parking lot (in the Peter Lougheed Park) and follows Powerline Road to the first bridge crossing of Fox Creek. Hikers should continue on the right fork of road (look for signs bearing the symbol of a hiker) and keep going approximately 100 metres past Blueberry Hill Trail. At this point there will be the next “hiker” symbol; take the trail to the right which leads to West Elk Pass Trailhead and the provincial boundary.\n</p>\n<div>\n  <img src=\"elk-lake2.jpg\" alt=\"Lower Elk Lake\" title=\"Lower Elk Lake\" class=\"legacy-image\">\n  Lower Elk Lake\n</div>\n<p>\n  <strong>A Special Word about “Routes”:</strong>\n  As well as many designated trails, Elk Lakes Park also has several informal “routes” that are not maintained and, at best, include intermittent stretches where a beaten path is available. Moderate scrambling and travel through fairly dense undergrowth and occasionally through tangled slide areas is required. These routes offer excellent scenic opportunities; however, they are not recommended for small children. Hikers travel these routes at their own risk. Route-finding skills and an aptitude for orienteering are essential, and it is recommended that hikers obtain the appropriate topographical maps prior to arrival. Off-trail travel increases your chances of encountering a bear –\n  <em>\n    <strong>travel cautiously!</strong>\n  </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Upper Elk Lake to Coral Pass:</strong>\n  This is a very demanding hike, but is eminently worthwhile. The Neville drainage offers superb views and some fine examples of fossilization. It is illegal to gather and remove fossils. Please leave them where found for future visitors to enjoy. From Petain Creek, follow an old trail through timber. After crossing Neville Creek travel is easy along the outwash plain. At the base of the Neville headwall is a snow-filled canyon – avoid the snow. Travel on the left side of the creek. Access is possible up an avalanche chute approximately 500 metres before you reach the headwall/canyon, then traverse between rock bands and follow a goat trail through the upper band on the east end to treed benches above. Coral Pass is located at the west end of the basin. Access to Cadorna Lake is possible.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Lower Elk Lake to Frozen Lake:</strong>\n  This moderate hike offers fine views of alpine vistas and a superb look at Mount Fox and Frozen Lake – it’s a very worthwhile outing. Follow either of the trails that take you to West Elk Pass. A hundred metres west of the Pass boundary the cutline is apparent. This is the most distinct route to Frozen Lake.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Petain Creek Waterfalls to Petain Basin:</strong>\n  Distance, 4 km. Estimated hiking time, 2 hours. Elevation change: 520 metres. This strenuous hike gives access to either mountaineering opportunities or else a pleasant amble throughout the Petain Basin. There are great views of the Castelnau icefall and the Petain Creek waterfalls. Follow the Petain Creek Waterfall Trail until it breaks out of the trees and the Petain Waterfall is first visible. At this point a faint trail leads to the right and follows the east side of an avalanche chute. At a small waterfall, the trail crosses to the west of the chute and follows it up until it breaks away to the left in a meadow near the treeline. From this point, watch for rock cairns marking the route into the basin.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Cadorna Trailhead to Pass in the Clouds (access to Height of the Rockies Provincial Park):</strong>\n  This is a historic route used by Indigenous and early visitors to access the Elk and White rivers. It is not recommended for horse travel as there is exposure on a steep scree talus slope in the pass area. Follow the Abruzzi Trail description. Continue on the seismic trail past the junction up to the lake. At the end of the valley the trail becomes obscure. It may be found north of the main creek. Climb steeply to the northwest to a high point on the trail. Strike off through the brush west by northwest, at which point you may intersect another trail. Approach the Pass from the north as there is a steep, scree-filled draw directly below the narrow pass.\n</p>",

It is recommended that hikers venturing off the main trails inform a responsible friend or family member of their hiking plan, including destination, departure, and return time and date. For your own safety and the preservation of the park, obey posted signs and keep to designated trails.

This hike will introduce you to Haida legends and culture, old growth forest, the Hiellen River, open ocean, fascinating geologic features, and wonderful views and wildlife.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Cape Fife Trail\n  </strong>\n  – For more adventurous and better equipped hikers, the 10km (one way) hike to the Cape Fife Cabin on East Beach offers the chance to hike old-growth forest on a semi-maintained and well marked trail that takes you past bogs, evidence of settler structures, and to endless beaches. The cabin has four bunks, a woodstove, outhouse, and is available on a first come basis (no reservations), so be sure to have a tent for backup if you wish to stay the night. There is little water on this route so be prepared.

Wear waterproof footwear, be very careful of the delicate landscape, and avoid leaving the trail as it is easy to get lost. The trail continues to the Heralda Lakes (4km), then you return the way you came.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Pesuta Shipwreck Trail</strong>\n  – Starting at the Tlell River Day Use area the Pesuta Shipwreck Trail takes you through old-growth forest down to the bank of the Tlell River, leading you to the dunes and seemingly endless East Beach where the remnant bow of the log barge “Pesuta”, which was beached in December 1928, is all that remains of this 264 foot log carrier. Best to approach this hike on a low or receding tide to avoid walking the riverbank during high water – 6km one way.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Misty Meadows</strong>\n  – Starting near the Misty Meadows day-use picnic shelter, there is a trail that winds through the meadows and forest to the dunes and beach, then circles to the trail that brings you back to the picnic shelter – ~1km.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>East Beach Trail</strong>\n  – For the dedicated and well-prepared, the East Beach Trail is a truly remote experience.

There were many who chose to homestead in the area   that is now Naikoon Park, growing vegetables, raising cattle and   taking gold from the sand beaches. However, difficult drainage,   poor access, World War I and the lack of markets caused most people   to abandon their efforts before the Great Depression. Many of the   place names in the area are reminders of their presence.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  Naikoon park is the traditional territory of the Haida Nation and figures prominently in their present lifestyles and history. There are many places of cultural and spiritual importance as well as historic village sites and important food gathering sites throughout the park.<br>\n  <br>Naikoon is  a corruption of “Nai-kun” meaning “house point” – the Haida name  for Rose Spit. This five kilometre point of land juts northward  from  the park separating the riotous waters of Dixon Entrance and Hecate  Strait. The park was created to help preserve the natural diversity  of this unique coastline.\n</p>\n<a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>Cultural   Heritage</h2>\n<p>\n  Haida Gwaii has been called “The Misty Islands”, referring not only   to the moist, mild climate, but to the mystique of its inhabitants, the Haida Nation. Visitors to Naikoon can easily find   the solitude to reflect on the highly developed culture of these   legendary seafarers, with their reputation for adventure, 20-metre   dugout canoes, fascinating ceremonies and ferocious exploits. The   art of the Haida Nation is famous throughout the world. Majestic and intriguing   cedar totem poles and carvings, argillite statuary and intricately   designed woven baskets and hats of spruce root were once representations   of a clan’s wealth and prestige. These and many items were frequently   given away at potlatches to help cement the socially complex kinship   system.\n</p>\n<a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>Conservation</h2>\n<p>The park occupies  part of the Hecate Depression, a trough between the Outer Mountains to  the west and the Coast Mountains on the mainland to the east. The park  is largely low and flat. Most of its topographic features are formed by  underlying glacial deposits. In the northeast corner, Argonaut Hill, the  highest point in the park, rises only 150 metres above sea level. Tow  Hill, an outcrop of basalt columns, is a prominent landmark about 100  metres high on the north beach.</p>\n<a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>Wildlife</h2>\n<p>\n  Wildlife is   a curious mixture of introduced and native species. Sitka Blacktail   deer were brought in about 80 years ago and, with abundant forage   and no wild predators, they have prospered. Other species such as   raccoons, red squirrels, beaver, and muskrat have been introduced.   Small herds of wild cattle, remnants of domestic stock from the   days of early settlement, have been seen along the east coast.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  Species native   to the park area include black bear, marten, river otter, and several   other mammals that made the salt water crossing from the mainland.   Sea mammals include dolphins and harbour porpoises. Hair seals can   be seen regularly at Rose Spit and all along the north and east   beaches. Northern fur seals and California grey whales migrate northward   during May and June.<br>\n  <br>\n  The bird population   of Haida Gwaii is similar to the nearby mainland although many   species have not crossed Hecate Strait. Others, such as the hairy   woodpecker, the saw-whet owl and Steller’s Jay, have developed into   unique sub-species. A sub-species of pine grosbeak is found only   on Haida Gwaii and Vancouver Island. A sub-species of song sparrow   is found here and on the Alaskan Islands.\n  <br>\n  <br>Rose Spit is   an excellent spot for observing migrating birds travelling south   on the Pacific Flyway. Upwelling currents produce much food along   the spit, attracting pelagic species rarely seen from the shore.   Sandhill cranes gather here after nesting in the park bogs and shorebirds   abound.\n</p>",

      "content": "<a name=\"History\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>\n  Skagit Valley Provincial Park went through multiple manifestations on the way to gaining its current size and status. During the High Ross controversy, approximately 1500 hectares of the valley was designated as Skagit River Provincial Park in 1970. This was replaced by the much larger Skagit Valley Recreation Area in 1973. Most of Skagit Valley Recreation Area was converted to class “A” provincial park in 1996.\n</p>\n<a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>Cultural   Heritage</h2>\n<p>\n  Oral traditions and archaeological evidence show that humans have been using the Skagit Valley since shortly after the continental glaciers receded from this area at the end of the last ice age, approximately ten thousand years ago. The Skagit Valley is rich in many resources which indigenous peoples gathered. Hozomeen chert, a high quality toolstone, was quarried for thousands of years from multiple sites in the area, on both sides of what is today the Canada-US border. The 49th parallel which cuts across the Skagit Valley was not a boundary between different peoples prior to colonization, and now divides the traditional territories of many indigenous groups. The Skagit Valley is recognized as part of the traditional territories of multiple Coast Salish and Interior Salish peoples who maintain strong connections to this land.\n</p>\n<h3>Colonial History</h3>\n<p>The Oregon Treaty, signed in 1846, established the 49th parallel as the border between the United States and British North America from the Rocky Mountains to the Salish Sea, a continuation of the borderline previously established across the prairies. Two boundary commission teams, one British and one American, surveyed the Skagit Valley in 1858 to determine the location of the 49th parallel. A clearcut swath twenty feet (approximately six metres) wide marks the international border. The swath receives regular maintenance to keep it free from trees, and border monuments are placed periodically along the boundary. Monument 73 can be seen from the Silver Skagit Road.</p>\n<p>A few settlers tried homesteading in the Skagit Valley on either side of the border in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Whitworth Horse Camp is named for a family who built a ten-room ranch house in 1906 in the meadow that lies just west of the campground. Illness befell the family and by 1911 they had abandoned their ranch.\n</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, in 1910 two American prospectors, Dan Greenwald and W.A. Stevens, reportedly made a significant gold strike at nearby Steamboat Mountain (now known as Shawatum Mountain), which today lies partially within Skagit Valley Provincial Park and partially within E.C. Manning Provincial Park. Greenwald and Stevens founded Steamboat Mountain Gold Mines, Ltd. and began selling shares. Prospectors flocked to the area with merchants in Hope, Chilliwack and Princeton competing to supply the miners. Three rival townsites sprang up near the base of the mountain – Steamboat, Steamboat Mountain and Steamboat City. In May 1911 it was reported that between 300 and 550 men were prospecting in the area. However, despite all the activity, one thing was missing – gold. In June 1911 it was revealed that the area had been laced, or salted, with gold from elsewhere. The entire endeavor had been a hoax! By this time, Greenwald and Stevens had quietly sold their interests and returned to the United States. The Steamboat townsites were abandoned and the Steamboat name was tarnished. Local communities reverted to calling the mountain Shawatum, as it was named on the maps produced by the boundary commission surveys. The Halq'eméylem name for this mountain is Sleha:wetem, meaning \"hunting place.\"</p>\n<h3>Skagit Hydroelectric Project</h3>\n<p>The early 1900s saw the beginnings of other plans that would result in more profound impacts on the valley. Following the invention of the electric light bulb in 1879, urban centres around the world began to undertake large-scale electricity production, frequently achieved by burning coal. Cities suffered high levels of air pollution as the unfiltered smoke from electricity plants mixed with smoke from cooking, heating, and other industrial activities. With rapidly growing demand for electricity in Seattle and the surrounding area, several private and public utilities raced to secure good sites for hydroelectric projects to expand production and improve air quality.</p>\n<p>J.D. Ross, the Canadian-born superintendent of Seattle’s public electricity utility from 1911 until his death in 1939, worked diligently to secure permits for a hydroelectric project on the upper part of the Skagit River in Washington State. Seattle began work on the Skagit Hydroelectric Project in 1917. This project would eventually consist of three dams, each increasing in size – Gorge, Diablo, and Ross.\n</p>\n<p>Construction of Ross Dam began in 1937. The original plans for Ross Dam consisted of four stages. The final height of the dam was to be 203m (665 feet) and would create a reservoir that would flood a large area of the Skagit Valley north of the international boundary in BC. In order to flood across the border, the project needed approval from the International Joint Commission (IJC), the organization that oversees water issues between Canada and the United States. Seattle presented its case at a hearing in the fall of 1941. At the time, Canada was two years into fighting World War II and the US joined the war a few months later. Abundant electricity for the war effort was an important concern. The IJC gave approval for Seattle’s proposal in January of 1942; however, Seattle would have to work out with British Columbia how it would compensate the province for the land that would be flooded.</p>\n<p>Despite the concern for the war effort, electricity production didn’t begin until the third stage of Ross Dam was completed in 1949, after the end of WWII. Stage three was 165m (540 ft) tall and would flood only a small piece of land on the BC side of the border, approximately 257 hectares (635 acres). The valley floor was cleared of trees to prepare for flooding. The Silver Skagit Road that provides access to Skagit Valley Provincial Park was originally built to remove this timber from the valley. Seattle and the Province of British Columbia agreed to compensation for this flooding in 1954.</p>\n<p>Before beginning work on the final stage of Ross Dam, or “High Ross” Dam, Seattle and British Columbia negotiated compensation for the 2225 hectares (5500 acres) of land that would be flooded in BC by the much larger reservoir. This agreement wasn’t signed until 1967. In the meantime, the access provided by the Silver Skagit Road had helped make the area popular with outdoor enthusiasts in the Lower Mainland, particularly fly fishers, and public attitudes towards the environment and resource development had seen a significant shift.\n</p>\n<p>North Cascades National Park Service Complex in Washington State was established in 1968 after considerable effort by local recreationists and conservationists, notably the North Cascades Conservation Council (N3C). The new park complex encompassed the land surrounding all three of the reservoirs of the Skagit Hydroelectric Project other than the tip of Ross Lake that extends into Canada. The news that a compensation agreement had been signed and Seattle intended to raise Ross Dam to its full height gained public attention in 1969. Many citizens on both sides of the border strongly opposed raising the dam and a protest movement quickly gathered strength. A group calling themselves the R.O.S.S. Committee (Run Out Skagit Spoilers) spearheaded the movement in BC, with N3C leading the American protest. Working together, along with other organizations and citizens on both sides of the border, these groups fought through the 1970s and into the 1980s to prevent further flooding of the Skagit Valley.\n</p>\n<p>Eventually, the protestors achieved their goal. Canada and the United States signed a new 80-year treaty in 1984 limiting the flooding to stage three of Ross Dam. The cornerstone of the agreement was to replace the High Ross project with power from BC. The terms of the treaty are in effect from 1986 to 2066.</p>\n<p>The 1984 treaty also established the Skagit Environmental Endowment Commission. This international commission manages an endowment fund with the mission of improving and protecting the ecosystems, cultural values, and recreational opportunities of the Skagit Watershed upstream of Ross Dam. This area includes all of Skagit Valley Provincial Park and parts of E.C. Manning Provincial Park and North Cascades National Park Service Complex.</p>\n<p></p>\n<a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>Conservation</h2>\n\n<h3>Geography, Geology and Climate</h3>\n<img src=\"images/international-point-beach-area.jpg\" alt=\"International Point Beach Area\" title=\"International Point Beach Area\" class=\"legacy-image\">\n<p>Skagit Valley Provincial Park lies approximately 150 km east of Vancouver in the North Cascade Mountains. The Skagit River begins near Allison Pass in E.C. Manning Provincial Park and runs west to join the Sumallo River where it turns south and enters Skagit Valley Park. Shortly before reaching the international boundary with the United States, the river flows into Ross Lake, a reservoir created by Ross Dam in Washington State. The park covers 27,948 hectares of land and borders E.C. Manning Provincial Park to the east and North Cascades National Park Service Complex to the south. These parks form part of a significant area of connected protected lands that span the international border.</p>\n<p>The Skagit Valley is a broad, U-shaped valley carved during the ice ages by advancing continental glaciers. Jagged peaks on surrounding mountains indicate where they protruded above the grinding ice that rounded off the lower mountains. The elevation where the jagged peaks begin indicates that the ice filling the Skagit Valley reached more than 1.5km thick.\n</p>\n<p>Skagit Valley Provincial Park sits in the transition zone between the wet, moderate climate found on the western slopes of the North Cascades and the dry, more extreme climate of their eastern slopes. The rain shadow effect of the mountains to the west limits the annual precipitation to about half that of nearby Hope, but the area still receives about twice the precipitation of the Okanagan Valley on the eastern edge of the mountains. Most precipitation usually falls during the winter, creating deep snowpack at higher elevations. Summers are typically dry and warm.\n</p>\n<p>Ross Lake is a hydroelectric reservoir and the water level in the lake changes dramatically throughout the year. This is the result of both human management and the local climate. As precipitation on the mountains falls as snow during colder months, more water is released through the dam than flows into the reservoir and the water level in the lake slowly drops. The lake usually reaches its lowest in mid to late April when snow stops accumulating and begins to melt. The amount of snowpack helps dam managers determine how low the water is drawn down. Winter \"drawdown\" may be as much as 30m (100 ft) or more below \"full pool\" (the maximum height of the reservoir). As spring gets warmer and snow on the mountains melts more quickly, the water in the reservoir can rise 30-60cm (1-2 ft) per day. The reservoir is approximately 36km long when at full pool. Many kilometres of lakebed are exposed during drawdown.</p>\n<h3>Biodiversity (Diversity of Life)</h3>\n<img src=\"images/rhododendron.jpg\" alt=\"International Point Beach Area\" title=\"Rhododendron\" class=\"legacy-image\">\n<p>Skagit Valley Provincial Park covers a varied landscape from the valley bottom to high mountain peaks, with many different microclimates, patches of old-growth forest, and overlap of coastal and interior species. This creates a diversity of habitats and rich biodiversity within the park. Several species of flora and fauna (plants and animals) are at the eastern or western edges of their ranges. The north-south orientation of the Skagit Valley also makes it an important migration and dispersal route for many species, and a connection corridor between populations in British Columbia and Washington State.</p>\n<img src=\"images/pacific-treefrog.jpg\" alt=\"International Point Beach Area\" title=\"Pacific Tree Frog\" class=\"legacy-image\">\n<p>The Skagit watershed is noted to support some of the greatest plant diversity in BC and is the only area on the mainland where Pacific Rhododendron is known to grow naturally. The valley bottom is dominated by the interior variety of Douglas-fir trees, mixed with Western Hemlock, Western Redcedar and stands of Lodgepole Pine. At higher elevations, stands of Engleman Spruce, Subalpine Fir and Whitebark Pine mingle with subalpine meadows that burst with colour from countless wildflowers during their short growing season. Four ecological reserves were created in the Skagit Valley for significant plant communities characterized by Black Cottonwood, Pacific Rhododendron, transitional interior Douglas-fir, and Ponderosa Pine.\n</p>\n<p>Skagit Valley Provincial Park continues to support most wildlife species native to this area. Mule/Blacktail Deer and Black Bears are commonly seen along the road and around the campgrounds. Moose and Grey Wolves leave occasional signs of their passing. Cougars, Lynx and Martens search the valley for prey, but rarely reveal themselves. Close to a dozen species of bats live in the valley, some of whom are seen skimming the surface of Ross Lake at sunset.</p>\n<p>Pacific Treefrogs chorus along the edge of Ross Lake at night, and Western Toads rustle through forest leaves in the dark. Common Garter Snakes can be found hunting for amphibians along the lake edge, and Northern Alligator Lizards are sometimes seen basking in the sun.\n</p>\n<p>More than 150 species of birds use the Skagit Valley as a nesting area, a migration corridor, or a wintering ground. Common Mergansers raise their families on Ross Lake while the ethereal calls of Common Loons drift across the water. American Dippers and families of Harlequin Ducks work to find aquatic insects hiding under rocks in the Skagit River. Barn Swallows perform aerobatic stunts while hunting flying insects near the park buildings where they nest. Bald Eagles and Osprey soar above the lake hunting for Rainbow Trout near the surface of the water.</p>\n<p>Collecting water from the numerous mountain streams that cascade down the surrounding hillsides, the Skagit River runs clear and cold, providing habitat for Rainbow Trout, Bull Trout and Dolly Varden.</p>\n<p></p>\n<a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2></h2>\n",

This is resulting in increased erosion and  will soon permanently alter the environment along the trail. Stay  on the trail! Failure to comply will result in prosecution and  eviction from the park.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Stop 1 – Getting Around Shuswap Lake:</strong>\nCanoes carried the first  Europeans here, but by the 1870s paddle-wheelers frequently transported  people between Kamloops and communities on the lake. The Canadian  Pacific Railway, and later an expanded road system, resulted  in a much easier movement of people and goods. Starting  in the 1950’s,  the increase of private cars brought a new industry to Shuswap  Lake: summer recreation.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Stop 2 – A Tree Called Douglas:</strong>\nThe Douglas-fir  is best distinguished by its cone with the three-forked bracts  that stick between each cone scale. Seeds are released when the  cone dries and opens. On older trees the bark becomes thick and  deeply furrowed, the tough thick bark making them fire resistant.  Specimens of this large size are now rarely seen because they are  so valuable as timber.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Stop 3 – Sunshine, Shade and Trees:</strong>\nIn the drier, sunny places, such as along the lakeshore, grow  trees like the ponderosa pine,  typical of the valleys south and west of the park. Most of the  park is in the lee of Bastion Mountain, where protection from  the afternoon sun allows growth of trees typical of the wetter,  cooler  Columbia Mountains east of here: western hemlock, western red  cedar and western white pine.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Stop 4 – Shuswap Homestead Life:</strong>\nIn the late 1800’s, Dr. Herald, a young Vancouver physician, realized  his  health was suffering  from the wet coastal weather and decided to settle in the Shuswap  area. In the fall of 1905, he bought this farm from the Reinecker  family. The Herald family grew tomatoes, potatoes, onions,  raspberries and apples. They also grew grains to feed ten Jersey  cows. One  year spoiled milk was dumped on the vegetable garden, and the  result was a 360-pound pumpkin! The Heralds sold any surplus  produce in  the town of Canoe, a short trip across the lake (a good road  did not reach the farm until 1954). They shipped some produce,  like  raspberries, by rail to Calgary.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Stop  5 – Family Life:</strong>\nDundas and Edith Herald prospered and raised three children:  Jessie, James and Arthur. They were educated at  home and took piano lessons. (A piano was brought in from Alberta,  shipped by rail to Canoe and across the lake by scow, then hauled  up the hill). Jessie, the oldest child, lived here all her life.  She loved animals and compiled a list of over 70 species of birds  that she saw on the farm. The Herald family sold the 66 hectare  farm to the government of British Columbia in 1975 and it became  Herald Provincial Park.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Stop 6 – Entering the Canyon:</strong>\nThree plant species, douglas-maple, gooseberry and  red osier dogwood, flourish  in the stable but damp  conditions along the creek bank in this spectacular canyon.<br>\n<p></p>\n<br>\n<strong>Stop 7 – Cedars and Water Power:</strong>\nThe canyon’s calcium-rich soils are a perfect  growing medium for cedars and have resulted in these  mighty trees dominating the area. Below the bridge are the remains  of a dam built by the Herald family. The water (carried to the  farm by flume) was used to irrigate crops, to cool a root cellar  where dairy supplies were stored and to power various labour-saving  machines for chores such as sawing planks and sharpening tools.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Stop 8 – The Bedrock Story:</strong>\nThe limestone bedrock of this canyon  originated at the bottom of a prehistoric ocean. Skeletal remains  of small organisms accumulated on the ocean floor 550 million  years  ago and gradually hardened into limestone, now 300 to 600 metres  above sea level. How did this happen? The earth’s surface is  divided into rock “plates” that move, very slowly, over millions  of years. The plate containing the limestone collided with another  plate about 128 million years ago, forcing the limestone up to  its present position. Cracks were filled with calcite that was  dissolved into limestone. The calcite crystallized to become white  veins.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Stop 9 – A Wet World:</strong>\nPlants that thrive in the moist, humid shade now begin  to dominate. The plants include thimbleberry, foamflower,  mosses, tiger lily and northern bedstraw. Some, like the foamflower,  are found in drier areas in the park but they bloom longer and  grow more luxuriantly in the canyon.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Stop 10 – Devil’s Playground:</strong>\nA common plant of the interior wetbelt, devil’s club  is named for the many spines found along the stems  and underside of the leaves. Getting these spines in your skin  can cause irritation or even allergic reaction. The large leaves  trap as much light as possible, an important asset in the shady  forest understory. White flowers bloom in the last two weeks  of June with clumps of bright red berries appearing later in  the summer.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Stop 11 – Margaret Falls:</strong>\nMargaret Falls is named after  the first white woman to see this impressive falls. The water  originates at the top of Bastion Mountain that lies directly to the west,  and follows a fault in the limestone. The spray of the falls keeps  the vegetation moist and allows the mosses that adorn many of the  cedars to survive.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>CAUTION</strong>:  Stay on the trail! Attempting to climb beside the falls with  its steep, wet conditions could result in injury; it also damages  the soil and vegetation. Failure to comply will result in prosecution  and eviction from the park.\n<br>\n<br>Return to\n<a href=\"./\" class=\"legacy-link\">Herald Provincial Park</a>\n<p></p>",

      "content": "<h2>Season</h2>\n<p>\n  Tuaton and Laslui Lakes are not usually ice-free until mid-June.   River levels can be very high at this time and the canoeing   much more difficult. By mid-July river levels have usually dropped   and the prime canoeing season has begun. The most reliable weather   is usually during July and August while the best time to see   wildlife is during September and October.\n</p>\n<h2>Safety in Bear Country</h2>\n<p>\n  This is prime grizzly and black bear country. You should not   leave any packs or food boxes unattended along any trial or   waterway you travel. When camping over night, be sure that you   have put your food items in a safe place, well away from your   sleeping area. All garbage must be packed out. Do not bury garbage   as animals will just dig it up again.\n</p>\n<h2>River Boats</h2>\n<p>\n  Please note that river boats are permitted on the Stikine River   year-round. River boats are more commonly seen during the hunting   season. The use of river boats is restricted on the Spatsizi   River, upstream of Hyland Post, from break-up until September   1st of each year.\n</p>\n<h2>Fishing</h2>\n<p>\n  The rivers are generally quite muddy during June &amp; July,   but some good Arctic grayling can be had if you fish where the   smaller streams flow into the main rivers. In late August and   September the fishing improves. The Spatsizi and Stikine are   home to numerous rainbow trout, arctic grayling and dolly varden   char. All persons angling in BC must have the appropriate licence.\n</p>\n<h2>Campsites</h2>\n<p>\n  There are no designated campsites although there are several   campsites in and around the area. In addition, there are some   rustic campsites located at Tuaton Lake, Fountain Rapids Portage,   Chapea Portage, Beggarly canyon Portage and the Stikine River   bridge on Hwy 37.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If possible, camp on a sand or gravel bar as this has the least   effect on local vegetation. This allows the rivers to reclaim   your sites during high water.\n</p>\n<h2>Hiking</h2>\n<p>\n  On the Spatsizi River Canoe Route, there are two trails that   permit the canoeist to get off the river for a few hours or\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <h3>Mink   Creek Trail to Cold Fish Lake Camp</h3>\n  <p>\n    The first trail leads to Cold Fish Lake Camp via the Mink   Creek Trail. The trail is located on the downstream side of   Mink Creek. To find the trailhead, go past Mink Creek and   take the back channel on river left. From here you should   be able to spot flagging to indicate the trailhead. The trip   to Cold Fish Lake camp is approximately 20 km one way so several   days should be allowed to make this trip.\n    <br>\n  </p>\n  <h3>Spatsizi Plateau Trail</h3>\n  <p>\n    The Spatsizi Plateau Trail begins at Hyland Post. Please note   that Hyland Post is private property so please respect it   and ask permission to pass though this area. It takes approximately   two hours to hike up to Spatsizi Plateau. From here you can   spend several hours or several days on the plateau. Caribou   can often be seen on the open rolling hills and Stone sheep   may be seen on the rock escarpments.\n  </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n  On the Stikine   River Canoe Route, aside from limitless bush-whacking trips   to alpine areas, there are two short hikes to Shreiber Canyon   and Adoogacho Falls.<br>\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <h3>Shreiber Canyon Trail</h3>\n  <p>\n    2 km below the Pitman River is Shreiber Canyon. This canyon   is not on the Stikine River but on a small side creek. An   interesting short hike can be done up the canyon and for the   adventurous, on to the cliffs overlooking the Stikine.\n    <br>\n  </p>\n  <h3>Adoogacho Falls</h3>\n  <p>\n    A short hike up Adoogacho Creek leads to Adoogacho Falls.\n    <br>\n  </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Spatsizi/stikine River Canoe Route</h2>\n<p>\n  The Spatsizi/Stikine   River trip is\n  <strong>recommended for intermediate   to advanced canoeists</strong>\n  and takes a minimum of 6 to 9   days to complete. While the Spatsizi River is Grade I, the Stikine   portion of the trip has many Grade II rapids and sections of   Grade III and IV. There are no regular patrols on the river   so once on the river you are on your own. There are two guide-outfitter   camps on your route that may be of assistance in an emergency.   The first is Hyland Post, 10 km upstream of the confluence of   the Spatsizi and Stikine Rivers, and the other is Upper Stikine   Lodge, which is 2 km downstream of the confluence. These camps   are not always staffed so visitors should not depend upon them.\n</p>\n<h2>Access</h2>\n<p>\n  The Spatsizi River is accessible from the BC Rail Grade, via the 5 km Didene Portage Trail. The Didene Portage Trail can be reached from Hwy 37 (near Eddontenajon Lake) via the Ealue Lake Road. The Ealue Lake Road is a 22 km gravel road that leaves Hwy 37 and heads east towards the Klappan River. Once you have crossed the Klappan River, you are on the BC Rail Grade. Turn right (south) onto the BC Rail Grade and the Didene Portage Trailhead will be approximately 93 km south of the Ealue Lake Road and Klappan FSR junction. The Didene Portage Trailhead is approximately 115 km from Highway 37, all on gravel road.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Please note that the BC Rail Grade is not maintained and natural slides and washouts may close this access route at any given time.\n</p>\n<h2>Spatsizi   River Portage Trail</h2>\n<p>\n  This is a well maintained trail that travels down to the confluence   of the Spatsizi, Didene and Kluayetz Rivers. There are several   canoe rests along the trail. Once at the river, facilities include   a fire ring, a bear-proof food cache, a pit toilet, a creel   survey registration box and a visitor registration box (located   on the visitor information shelter). This site is user-maintained;   please pack-out what you pack-in.\n  <br>\n</p>\n<h2>Canoe Route – Spatsizi River Portion of the Spatsizi/Stikine   Canoe Route</h2>\n<p>\n  Once on the river you will find that it has many short, fast   runs over gravel bars, with many braided channels. This braiding   occurs mainly on the first 10 km of river below the put-in location.   The canoeist must always be on the look-out for gravel bars   and rocks and try to pick the best channel with the most water.   Also, you must be watching for sweepers, trees that have fallen   out over the river with branches hanging down into the water.   Sweepers are very common on the upper Spatsizi.\n</p>\n<p>\n  From the   junction of the Spatsizi River and Buckinghorse Creek downstream   to where Kliweguh Creek flows into the Spatsizi, the river grows   much larger and the valley becomes much wider. This section   offers some of the most scenic views along the entire waterway.   This area is ideal for spotting wildlife such as moose, black   bear, grizzly bear, wolf, mountain goat, caribou and the occasional   stone sheep high on mountain slopes.\n</p>\n<p>\n  From Kliweguh   Creek to the Stikine River, the Spatsizi River flows through   a wide valley of lodge-pole pine flats and semi-open grasslands,   with many good camping areas along the shoreline. The river   is much larger here and some braiding occurs downstream from   Kliweguh Creek to Hyland Post. The river is somewhat faster   in this area and the canoeist should always be reading the water,   watching for rocks, gravel bars, sweepers, etc. The river traveler   must keep in mind that long periods of rain or heavy storms   can make a significant increase in the water volume. This brings   swifter currents and less time to avoid any hazards and few   places to land a canoe.\n</p>\n<h2>Stikine   River Portion of Spatsizi/Stikine Canoe Route</h2>\n<p>\n  Located 15 km below the junctions of the Spatsizi and Stikine   Rivers is Jewel Rapids. This section can be extremely hazardous,   especially during high water, with ratings from Grade III to   IV depending on the water level. There are many large boulders   scattered through the channel that you must pick a route through.   These rapids should be scouted from shore before attempting   to run them. There is a sign located on the right bank of the   river shortly before you arrive at Jewel Rapids. There is no   portage trail to avoid Jewel Rapids.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>CAUTION: AS OF JUNE 2, 2004, THERE   IS NO WARNING SIGN INDICATING THE START OF JEWEL RAPIDS. BC   Parks will update this webpage once sign is re-installed.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n  At Beggerlay   Canyon, 20 km below the McBride River, there is a set of rapids   that should be portaged during high water. There are 3 signs   warning you of the rapids. The 3rd sign is located at the pull-out   at the head of the portage trail on the right bank. All canoeists   should land at the pull-out and scout the canyon thoroughly   before making a decision whether to run the rapids or to portage   around them.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Shortly   after leaving the Beggerlay Canyon, you will pass under an old   railway bridge and you are now only 17 km away from the end   of your trip. But there is still one more challenging section   of the river to navigate. This area is located some 15 km downstream   from the old railway bridge and should be approached with caution.   After passing this area, you will soon reach the Highway 37   bridge. There is easy access to the vehicle parking area on   the right bank just below the bridge.\n</p>\n<h2>UPPER STIKINE RIVER CANOE ROUTE</h2>\n<p>\n  The Stikine   River canoe trip is\n  <strong>only recommended for   advanced canoeists with considerable wilderness experience.</strong>\n  There are many rapids, rocks and sweepers that must be avoided.   Although most of the Stikine River is Grade I, there are several   Grade II rapids and sections of Grade III and IV rapids that   must be run. There are no regular patrols on the river; once   on the river you are on your own. There are two guide-outfitter   camps on your route that may be of assistance in an emergency.   The first is located on the west end of Laslui Lake and the   other is Upper Stikine Lodge, 2 km downstream of the confluence   of the Spatsizi and Stikine Rivers. These camps are not always   staffed so visitors should not depend upon them.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The trip   length is 225 km from Tuaton Lake to the pull-out at the Highway   37 bridge. You should allow a minimum of 8 days to complete   this trip. It is possible to be picked up by floatplane at Upper   Stikine Lodge (guide-outfitters camp). This must be arranged   prior to starting your trip. Late season pick-ups may not be   available due to low water levels.\n</p>\n<h2>Access</h2>\n<p>\n  The Stikine River route can be started at either Tuaton or Laslui   Lake, both of which are accessible to float planes. Please note   only permitted air charter companies are permitted to fly within.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The canoe route starts off easily, going down Tuaton and Laslui   Lakes and the section of river between them. Approximately 1.5   km downstream of Laslui Lake are the impassable Fountain Rapids,   which must be portaged. There is a sign located at the pull-out   on the right hand bank. A 1 km long portage trail goes around   the rapids on the right bank. From this point the river changes   character and the canoeing becomes much more challenging and   strenuous. White water and standing waves are nearly constant.\n</p>\n<p>\n  8 km downstream   is the second portage around the Grade III Chapea Rapids just   below Chapea Creek. Look for the sign located on the left bank   indicating the pull-out for the portage trail. The portage trail   is 1 km in length and is located on the left bank, which takes   you around the Chapea rapids.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>CAUTION: AS OF JULY 24, 2015, THERE IS NO WARNING SIGN INDICATING THE START OF CHAPEA RAPIDS.&nbsp; BC Parks will update this webpage once sign is re-installed.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n  The canoeing   continues to be challenging until Moyez Creek. Once at Moyez   Creek, you have covered the most difficult section of the river.   The rapids downstream from here are more widely spaced and the   canoeing easier. For details on the remainder of the canoe route,   see the Stikine River Portion of the Spatsizi/Stikine Canoe   Route.\n</p>\n<h2>Other Points to Consider</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>File a trip plan and estimated time of arrival with a trusted friend   or relative.</li>\n  <li>A number of cabins and active camps will be seen along the rivers.   You should not use these facilities unless prior permission   has been obtained.</li>\n  <li>In order to carry a firearm, you are required to have the appropriate   licence(s): a Possession Only Licence (POL) or a Possession   and Acquisition Licence (PAL).</li>\n  <li>A British Columbia angling licence is required if you intend to fish.

The most common access points originate at the BC Railgrade (Klappan Railgrade) that intersects with the Ealue Lake Forest Service Rd, near Iskut.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>McEwan Trail:</strong>\n<br>\nThis trail leads off the railgrade at the 28km marker. It leads through Stikine River Provincial park and into Spatsizi Plateau Wilderness Provincial Park near the north boundary of the park. It then crosses Cullivan Creek and heads south toward Bug Lake and then on to Cold Fish Lake camp. The trail is approximately 54 km long, and takes 4-5 days to hike to Cold Fish Lake camp. This trail can have muddy and boggy sections that can be difficult, especially in wet weather. It is recommended that persons bringing horses into the park use this trail rather than the Eaglenest trail.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Eaglenest Trail:\n</strong>\n<br>\nThis trail leads off the railgrade at the 50km marker. It meets Eaglenest Creek and follows it to Gladys Lake Ecological Reserve and proceeds through Danihue Pass to Black Fox Lake, where it meets the McEwan trail heading to Cold Fish Lake camp. A couple of unmaintained routes lead off this trail. However, these are unmarked and unmaintained. The Gladys Lake Ecological Reserve is\n<strong>closed to camping, hunting, fishing, fires or collecting</strong>. Please refrain from any of these activities while traversing this portion of the trail. This trail is similar in length to the McEwan trail and hikers should allow 4-5 days to hike this trail depending on their experience and current weather and trail conditions. This trail has muddy and boggy sections that can be difficult. There are also portions that proceed through willow flats and can be overgrown in places. Persons bringing horses into the park should consider utilizing the McEwan trail instead.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Cold Fish Lake camp hiking trails:\n</strong>\n<br>\nThere are several hiking trails in the vicinity of Cold Fish Lake camp that can provide day hiking or overnight opportunities.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Airplane Valley Trail:\n</strong>\n<br>\nThis trail commences at the airstrip on the north end of Cold Fish Lake and crosses the stream flowing into Cold Fish Lake. It then climbs up through the forest on the opposite side of Cold Fish Lake from the camp, to near treeline. This trail enters Gladys Lake Ecological Reserve. It takes approximately 1 to 2 hours to hike to the entrance to Airplane Valley from Cold Fish Lake camp and is a moderate climb. The trail ends at Gladys Ecological Reserve.&nbsp; The bridge beyond the trailhead has been washed out, flagging tape leads the way to a temporary foot crossing (not recommended or maintained) beyond this creek the trail is subject to flooding for a few hundred metres.&nbsp; A secondary trailhead to by-pass the creek and flooded section can be reached by canoe or boat on Cold Fish Lake.&nbsp; Look for flagging tape and a rustic trail sign along the western shore of the lake a few hundred metres beyond the lake outflow.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Danihue Pass Trail:</strong>\n<br>\nFrom Cold Fish Lake this trail commences beyond the airstrip along the Bug Lake Trail; after crossing the bridge you will reach the Danihue/Bug Lake junction. Danihue Pass Trail climbs steadily through the forest and opens up into alpine approximately 1-2 hours from Cold Fish Lake and from there continues to climb moderately through rolling hills and meadows over the pass.&nbsp; The trail is fairly easy to follow and provides access to both the Eagles Nest Trail and Ice Box Canyon Trail, though signage is not regularly maintained and junctions may not be well marked.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Cold Fish Lake Trail:</strong>\n<br>\nThis trail follows the shoreline of Cold Fish Lake and can be hiked to the south end of Cold Fish Lake to where Mink Creek flows out. The trail continues on to the Guide Outfitter camp at Hyland Post (private property), or if you cross Mink Creek can lead into Gladys Lake Ecological Reserve and eventually lead back to the Eaglenest Trail at Danihue Pass. There are a couple of private cabins along the trail. Please respect these facilities. In several places the trails become braided, and it is easy to confuse the route with other game trails. Be sure to bring a good map and compass to avoid becoming disoriented.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Black Fox Creek Trail:\n</strong>\n<br>\nThis trail commences at Cold Fish Lake camp and follows Black Fox Creek. This a moderately steep day hike. Plan an entire day to hike this trail depending on your fitness level. There are portions that can be wet or muddy depending on the amount of rain and use of the trail.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Spatsizi Plateau trail:\n</strong>\n<br>\nThis trail also commences at Cold Fish Lake camp and leads up to the Plateau above the camp. This hike makes a good day hike from Cold Fish Lake camp, and provides the opportunity to observe wildlife on the Plateau and offers good views of the surrounding area.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Gladys Lake Trail:\n</strong>\n<br>\nThis trail commences at the south end of Cold Fish Lake and leads through the Gladys Lake Ecological Reserve. The trail can be accessed from the Cold Fish Lake trail by crossing Mink Creek (No bridge), or from the shore of Cold Fish Lake, which can be reached by canoe or boat (Look for flagging tape along the south-east shore beside a stream). This trail braids in places and is crossed by game trails. Caution should be exercised to ensure that hikers do not become confused and disoriented. A map and compass should be used to ensure the correct heading. This trail loops through the Gladys Lake Ecological Reserve and back to the Eaglenest Trail at Danihue Pass but this section of trail is not frequently maintained or travelled and may be overgrown.\n<strong>Please plan your trip carefully;</strong>\nthere is\n<strong>no camping,</strong>\n<strong>fires, fishing or hunting permitted within the Ecological Reserve.\n</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Please be advised that all of these trails are wilderness trails.</strong>\nThese trails are not frequently travelled or maintained by BC Parks staff. The trail conditions are often challenging, wet or boggy sections and blown down trees are common, and at times the trails may be impassable due to weather or stream conditions. Visitors and hikers that intend to use these trails should be well equipped, and experienced in hiking and backcountry camping.<br>\n<br>Return to\n<a href=\"./\" class=\"legacy-link\">Spatsizi Plateau Wilderness Provincial Park</a>",

Firewood must be obtained   from one of the many outlets around the lake rather than gathered   from the forest. Taking live or dead wood out of the forest removes   nutrients needed by plants, insects and fungi that are essential   elements of the ecosystem.<br>\n<br>Please be considerate   of other people on the lake and treat the natural environment with   care. Disturbance of other visitors, cutting of trees or burning   of bush wood, and use of fireworks will not be tolerated in any   of the marine parks. Violators will face fines and eviction and   houseboat renters could well experience termination of their houseboat   holiday.<br>\n<br>If you observe   others violating park regulations or other laws, contact the RCMP   (911) with as much information as you can safely record.<br>\n<br>This information   is intended to clarify what expectations marine park visitors should   have.

Animals that lose their fear  of people and become habituated to human food and garbage are  especially dangerous. Bears are particularly unpredictable.  Never approach or feed bears or other animals. Store and dispose  of your food and refuse so wildlife, especially bears, can't  get it. Use facilities provided. Please don't leave garbage  at isolated sites. For more information on bear safety,\n<a href=\"/plan-your-trip/visit-responsibly/wildlife-safety\">click here</a>.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Marine  Park Boundaries:</strong>\nThe boundaries of all marine parks  on the Shuswap Lake are marked with blue and white signs on  the beach.\n<a href=\"/reservations/camping-fees\">Fees</a>\napply  anywhere within the park boundaries including the 100 metre  foreshore.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Restrictions:</strong>\n<a href=\"/reservations/camping-fees\">Fees</a>\nare in effect for   all overnight use including camping, beaching, docking, mooring   and anchoring within 100 m, May 1 to September 30. Boaters overnighting   in marine parks must purchase camping permits in advance (except   Cinnemousun Narrows and Silver Beach). Permits are sold at most   marinas and tourist information centres and at Cinnemousun Narrows   and Silver Beach.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Explosives   (fireworks) are prohibited in British Columbia Provincial Parks.</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>\n  <a href=\"/explore/parkpgs/cinnemousun/\" class=\"legacy-link\">Cinnemousun   Narrows Park</a>\n  and Marble Point</strong>: Houseboats must not be beached between the signs on the southerly side of Cinnemousun Narrows or between the signs at Marble Point during the period of May 15th to Labour Day.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>\n  <a href=\"/explore/parkpgs/silver_bch/\" class=\"legacy-link\">Silver   Beach Park</a>\n</strong>: Houseboats must not be beached between the   signs indicating\n<em>no houseboats</em>.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Quiet time begins at 11 p.m.</strong>\nVisitors are requested to refrain   from late night parties, excessive noise and loud music.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Note special fishing regulations for Shuswap Lake.</strong>\nYou will need   a British Columbia Angling Licence if you plan to fish. Please   refer to\n<a href=\"/plan-your-trip/things-to-do/freshwater-fishing\">BC Environment Fishing Regulations Synopsis</a>.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Dogs must be on a leash at all times.</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Navigation and Travel Tips:</strong>\nThe shoreline of Shuswap is not complicated   and does not require refined navigational skills. Boaters should   be able to use a chart and compass in the event of reduced visibility   due to fog. As an aid in night sailing, permanent lights with   distinctive colours and flashing rates have been placed at various   points. BC Parks assumes no responsibility for unserviceable   lights. For navigation purposes, all boaters should consult   the most recent Canadian Hydrographic service chart, available   at most marinas. Major shallows are shown on the map but others   may exist. Use caution when running close to shore.<br>\n<br>Approach slowly when coming ashore due to the presence of offshore sandbars.   Lake levels can drop five to ten centimetres daily during the summer.<br>\n<br>Wind and weather information can be obtained by tuning radio stations   broadcasting from Kamloops (CHNL 610 KHz; CHNL 107.2 Mhz, CFJC   910 kHz; CBUFM 105.7 Mhz), and Salmon Arm (CKXR 580 kHz; CBUC   880 kHz). The lake can be quite rough during high winds.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Mooring and Float Use:</strong>\nSome sites do not have protected beaches.   During stormy weather, it is advisable to beach your boat stern   first and secure it with long ropes from the bow to pegs on   the shore. This will prevent waves from breaking over the stern   and filling your boat. Houseboats should be beached according   to instructions provided by the rental companies.<br>\n<br>Docks are provided in some areas for small craft only. Please do not   tie houseboats to these structures.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Water Safety:</strong>\nAn approved life jacket or personal flotation   device must be carried for every person onboard. All passengers   and crew should familiarize themselves with the characteristics   and methods for use of this equipment. Prolonged immersion in   cold water causes hypothermia or a lowering of the internal   body temperature. This condition will result in death unless   reversed. Familiarize yourself with modern techniques to revive   victims of reduced heat loss in water. Never give alcohol to   a victim of hypothermia. Use blankets and, if the person is   conscious, administer warm liquids and warm, moist air for breathing.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Garbage:</strong>\nPlease take your garbage with you from the lake to an authorized   disposal site.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>IF YOU SPOT A FOREST FIRE – DIAL 1-800-663-5555</strong>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Sites On Shuswap Lake</h3>\n<h4>\n  <strong>\n    <a name=\"mainarm\" href=\"/\"></a>Main Arm:</strong>\n</h4>\n<a href=\"/explore/parkpgs/cinnemousun/\" class=\"legacy-link\">\n  <strong>Cinnemousun   Narrows Provincial Park</strong>\n</a>\n<br>\n<div>\n  <img src=\"../cinnemousun/cinnemou4.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"legacy-image\" alt=\"\">\n  <br>\n  Cinnemousun Narrows Provincial Park</div>\nThis park is where the four arms of Shuswap meet.

Each   campsite is equipped with a bear cache (to store foodstuffs and   gear), a fire ring and pit toilet. Please use these designated areas.   There are two tent pads at the Murray river Crossing and eight at   the Monkman Lake sites. The km 13 campsite has it has access to water, a fire pit, a bear cache and a few tent spots. Camping at backcountry campsites is on a first-come   first-served basis. Campfires are permitted only in designated backcountry   campsites. Firewood is in short supply, so please keep fires small   for safety and to conserve firewood for the next hiker. Use of Primus-type   campstoves is encouraged.\n<br>\n<br>Hikers and wilderness campers are encouraged to fill out a volunteer   questionnaire giving information as to how many people are in their   party, destination, and schedule. Any comments about the park and   its amenities are also appreciated.\n<br>\n<br>The southeast section of Monkman Park holds several  beautiful aquamarine lakes, which are the source of the Murray  River. This area of the  park is considered to be prime grizzly bear habitat and extensive  human intrusion is not encouraged. Recently, the southern boundary  of Monkman was extended to include areas with high conservation  and recreation features, including the upper Fontoniko Creek,  the  Limestone Lakes area, and the rolling plateau to the west. This  addition protects old-growth spruce forests, unique geological  features,  and important recreation aspects of the park's terrain, wildlife,  and ecosystems.\n<br>\n<br>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"hiking\" href=\"/\"></a>Hiking</h2>\n<img src=\"monkman_shire_falls.jpg\" alt=\"Shire Falls cascading near the campsite\" class=\"legacy-image\">\n<strong>Day Hikes   and Backcountry Hikes</strong>: Monkman Provincial Park offers a small   but attractive selection of short hiking trails, including routes   to viewpoints of Kinuseo Falls and the Murray River, a 3-km trail   from the main campground to Kinuseo Falls, and the route around   the perimeter of a beaver pond. Day hikers wanting more of a stretch   can walk the Monkman Lake Trail as far as the\n<strong>Murray River Crossing</strong>,   an easy hike that is 7 km one way. The Murray River Crossing boasts   a suspension bridge, which can lead more serious explorers into   the park's interior.\n<br>\n<br>To the south of the Kinuseo Falls campground lies the main body of Monkman Provincial Park. Access is via the 63-km\n<strong>Monkman Lake Trail</strong>, which winds through this portion of the park and provides backpackers and hikers with an opportunity to experience the unspoiled splendor of the area. As beautiful as the trail to Monkman Lake is, it passes the most spectacular feature of the park, the Monkman Cascades. These are a series of ten stunning waterfalls along Monkman Creek that thunder over rock ledges separated by placid pools. The trail, which follows the historic Monkman Pass route, ends at Hobies cabin on the Herrick River 10 km beyond the southern boundary of the park.<br>\n<br>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"kinuseo\" href=\"/\"></a>Kinuseo Falls</h2>\n<img src=\"monkman4.jpg\" alt=\"photo of Kinuseo Falls in Monkman\" class=\"legacy-image\">\nConsidered one   of the great natural wonders of the province, Kinuseo Falls are   a highlight of Monkman Provincial Park.

With the Prince George regional population growing,   a need for additional park facilities within an hours drive of the   community was identified, and Dahl Lake Provincial Park was established   in 1981. An additional 830 hectares was added to the park in 2000   on the recommendation of the Prince George Land and Resource Management   Plan (LRMP).\n</p>\n<a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>Cultural Heritage</h2>\n<p>\n  There is no   documentation to suggest that the area has any significant history   of long-term habitation or use, but archaelogical sites associated   with the Carrier people have been found.\n</p>\n<a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>Conservation</h2>\n<p>\n  Dahl Lake Provincial   Park contributes to the preservation of a range of vegetation types   and wildlife species. Forest cover consists primarily of spruce   and pine with aspen, willow, and alder along the lakeshore and creeks.   Pockets of balsam, cottonwood, or birch are scattered throughout   the area and large old Douglas fir trees dot the northwest shore   of Dahl Lake.<br>\n  <br>The area has   a variety of habitat types supporting a diversity of wildlife species.   Large and small mammals are abundant and the relatively shallow   bays of Dahl Lake provide nesting and feeding sites for waterfowl.   The marsh areas surrounding Theodore Lake are particularly attractive   to ducks and geese.\n</p>\n<a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>Wildlife</h2>\n<p>\n  Wildlife found   in Dahl Lake Provincial Park include moose, black bear, wolf, and   coyote. Smaller mammals such as fox, beaver, otter, and muskrat   are also abundant. In addition to geese, ducks, and loons, other   common bird species at Dahl Lake include owls, eagles, and osprey.   Please respect the wildlife, especially in the spring when many   bird species use the shoreline of the lake to have and raise their   young.<br>\n  <br>Norman Lake has been stocked with rainbow trout in the past, and   although not heavily used, Dahl Lake has moderate fishing potential   as well.\n</p>",

A steady climb leads hikers into the sub-alpine (1,475m). The trail is well defined and boardwalk spans several swampy sections. In the sub-alpine the grade eases, and hikers can enjoy the spectacular views of the Bulkley Valley and the Telkwa Range. The trail swings east as it descentds to cross Lyon Creek before traversing Ramrock Pass (1,660m). From this point, hikers descend into Ganokwa Basin. The trail then leads past two mountain lakes and climbs northeastward onto a grassy slope. Trail markers lead hikers to “The Summit”, the divide of the Ganokwa, Driftwood and Little Joe watersheds and the intersection of the Lyon Creek, Little Joe Creek, and McCabe Trails.\n</p>\n<h2>\n  Harvey Mountain Trail\n</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"Babine_Mtns_Harvey_Mtn.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"legacy-link\">Harvey Mountain Trail map [PDF 1.96MB]\n    </a>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  (5 km, 2 hours one way, moderate to difficult trail)<br>\n  The trailhead is located 1km south of the Silver King Trail parking lot. A steady climb takes hikers into an open alpine hillside with views of Silver King Basin, Hudson Bay Mountain, and the Bulkley Valley. A short hike through the alpine leads to the summit of Harvey Mountain (1,744m).\n</p>\n<h2>\n  McCabe Trail\n</h2>\n<p>\n  (10 km*, 3-4 hours one way, moderate trail)<br>\n  Highly recommended for family and novice hikers, the McCabe Trail offers relatively easy access to the alpine. The trail departs the Silver King Trail immediately before Sunny Point. After ascending a steep mining road for 100m, the route narrows to an excellent trail on an easy grade. The trail travels along the north slopes of Harvey and Pyramid mountains, and passes Copper Lakes at 8.3 km. It continues upward and eastward until reaching “The Summit”.\n</p>\n<h2>\n  Silver King Basin Trail\n</h2>\n<p>\n  (9.2 km*, 2-3 hours one way easy to moderate trail)<br>\n  This trail is an old mining road that is an extension of the Driftwood Creek Road. It follows an easy grade for most of the way, emerging into the basin after 7 km. Hikers will enjoy the sub-alpine meadows of Silver King Basin, which are at peak bloom in mid-July. The Joe L’Orsa Cabin is reached at 8.5 km, and the trail continues on another 500m to the abandoned Silver King Mine. From here the Hyland Pass Trail climbs 1.3 km to Hyland Pass and then descends for 1 km to join the Cronin Creek Trail.\n</p>\n<h2>\n  Fletcher-Gardner Trail\n</h2>\n<p>\n  (13.5 km*, 4-5 hours one way, difficult trail)<br>\n  This trail is most enjoyable as an overnight hike to Lower Reiseter (Two Bridge) Lake. The first half of the trail is an old cat-track, while the second half is a single-track trail that ends at the lake. An alluvial fan located 100m along the southern shore of the lake provides an ideal campsite. This is a user maintained site. Please pack out what you pack in. The lake provides fishing opportunities for small Rainbow trout.\n</p>\n<p>\n  *From Driftwood Road Summer Parking Area\n</p>\n<h2>\n  Onion Mountain Road/Trail\n</h2>\n<p>\n  (8.6 km, 3-4 hours, difficult trail)<br>\n  This road/trail leaves Old Babine Lake Road 3.5 km northwest of the Babine Lake Road junction. It provides easy access to the open meadows of Ganokwa Basin, a special attraction in July when the meadows are in bloom.<br>\n</p>\n<h2>\n  Little Joe Creek Trail\n</h2>\n<p>\n  (8.4 km, 3-4 hours, moderate to difficult trail)<br>\n  The trail begins from a parking lot accessible by turning left at 30.5 km on Babine Lake Road. It follows a moderate uphill grade along the north bank of Little Joe Creek for 4 km and emerges into an open basin. The Eagle Pass Trail (2 km) into Higgins Basin leaves the trail in this area. The Little Joe Creek Trail does not actually lead to the Little Joe Lakes but parallels above them to “The Summit”.\n</p>\n<h2>\n  Cronin Creek Road/Trail\n</h2>\n<p>\n  (15 km, 5-6 hours, moderate to difficult trail)<br>\n  This gravel road departs Babine Lake Road at 32.5 km. It stays quite level for 10 km, at which point it leaves Cronin Creek and climbs steeply through a series of switchbacks for nearly 3 km. Along the way, visitors will see remnants of past mining operations. At 1,800m, the trail reaches a beautiful alpine environment on the northeast shoulder of Mt. Cronin. The trail continues west and ends near the picturesque Hyland Lakes. From here the Hyland Pass Trail (2.2 km) leads over Hyland Pass to meet up with the Silver King Trail at the abandoned Silver King Mine.<br>\n</p>\n<h2>\n  Higgins Creek Trail\n</h2>\n<p>(5.5 km, 3-4 hours, moderate trail)<br>\n  The Higgins Creek Trail departs the Cronin Creek Trail approximately 600m past the Cronin Creek crossing. This old road climbs the slopes above Higgins Creek to reach a historic mining camp and continues on to the head of the basin. The Eagle Pass Trail (2 km) can then be followed to join up with the Little Joe Creek Trail.\n</p>\n<h2>\n  Hyland Pass Trail\n</h2>\n<p>\n  (1.5 km, 1 hour)<br>\n  This trail serves as a connector between the Cronin Creek and Silver King Basin  trails. The pass is the saddle between Mount Cronin and Mount Hyland, the two  highest peaks in the park.\n</p>",

The first  permanent trail, the Anderson Brigade trail, was then established  in 1848 and subsequently, the original bridge was constructed in  1861 by Joseph W. Trutch and named after Princess Alexandra of  Wales. To recover the $45,000 construction cost for the 90 metre  bridge, a toll of $7.40 per ton was charged.

Andrew McCulloch was hired as the chief engineer in   May 1910. He had been involved in many CPR projects, including   the Spiral Tunnels near Revelstoke.<br>\n  <br>\n  McCulloch took on   the challenging task of building the railway over three major   mountain ranges. The Coquihalla subdivision included 38 miles   from the Coquihalla Summit to the junction with the CPR mainline   across the Fraser River from Hope. This section boasts the most   expensive mile of railway track in the world: $300,000 in 1914!   The construction was done almost exclusively by hand with the   assistance of a few horse drawn scrapers and some black powder.   His assistant engineers nick-named the railway “McCulloch’s   Wonder.”<br>\n  <br>The greatest challenge of this route was the Coquihalla gorge, just east   of Hope, where the river had cut a 300-foot-deep channel in   solid granite. Other engineers had suggested a mile-long tunnel   by-passing the gorge, but McCulloch chose to build directly   through it. Hanging in the gorge in a wicker basket, McCulloch   surveyed the canyon for a straight line of tunnels that could   be dug simultaneously. Cliff ladders, suspension bridges and   ropes allowed workers to complete what is, to this day, regarded   as a spectacular engineering feat.<br>\n  <br>The tunnels are known as the Othello Tunnels. McCulloch was an avid reader   of Shakespearean literature, and he used characters such as   Lear, Jessica, Portia, Iago, Romeo and Juliet to name stations   of the Coquihalla subdivision. The tunnels in the Coquihalla   Canyon were near the Othello station – thus, Othello Tunnels.   Many of the passengers on the Coquihalla line came expressly   to see and photograph the station boards and to send postcards   from the stations’ post offices as a souvenir. This added   an ironic touch of gentility to this adventurous journey.<br>\n  <br>\n  The Kettle Valley   Railway was officially opened on July 31, 1916. The line operated   both freight and passenger service between Vancouver and Nelson,   but the operation was plagued with snow and rock slides. In   a two year period in the 1930’s, the line operated for   only a few weeks.<br>\n  <br>On November 23, 1959, a washout was reported just north of the tunnels. The   400-foot washout was too large to be filled in one day, and   numerous other washouts added to the troubles of the maintenance   crews. The line was closed and never reopened; it was officially   abandoned in July of 1961. The tunnels and surrounding area   became a provincial recreation area in May of 1986.<br>\n  <br>Much of the modern four lane Coquihalla Highway is built upon the original rail   bed of the Kettle Valley Railway. Travelling at modern highway   speeds it is difficult to imagine the formidable task of constructing   a rail route through this rugged section of BC.<br>\n  <br>As you drive along the highway, you may notice some small signs in   the shape of an old steam locomotive, with Shakespearean names.   These signs commemorate the approximate locations of the Kettle   Valley Railway stations along today’s Highway #5.\n</p>\n<a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>Cultural Heritage</h2>\n<p></p>\n<a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>Conservation</h2>\n<p>\n  <br>Flowers,   trees and shrubs are part of the park’s natural heritage, please don’t   damage or remove them.</p>\n<a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>Wildlife</h2>\n<p>\n  Park users should always be aware of bears and other wildlife in our park environment.

Although lacking any formal facilities (e.g., picnic tables, toilets,  fire rings) the beach and foreshore areas of the park are popular among residents of  Fairmont Hotsprings as well as tourists visiting the Columbia Valley.</li>\n  <li>There are six other provincial parks (Windermere Lake, Dry  Gulch, James Chabot, Whiteswan Lake, and Thunderhill), within a 40  km radius of Columbia Lake Provincial Park. The latter, Thunderhill is located on   Columbia Lake. Within a 100 km radius of Columbia Lake, the  Regional District of the East Kootenay has two regional parks, Wycliffe and Tie  Lake, that offer similar day-use opportunities, but with a higher level of facility  development than Columbia Lake Provincial Park.</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>Cultural Heritage</h2>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>First Nations have been present in the Columbia Valley for  over 10,000 years and the area surrounding and including the park was extensively used  by members of both the Ktunaxa and Shuswap cultural groups in the pre-colonial period.</li>\n  <li>There are a total of 10 known archaeological sites (Borden unit classification) within the park boundary. These include sites  associated with debris or waste material from past activity (e.g., tool or weapon making) or depressions  that were created by human excavation and could represent former locations of storage  pits, food processing facilities or semi-subterranean lodges.</li>\n  <li>The Spirit Trail (also known as the Fairmont Trail and the Plains  of Nativity) passes through the park. This transportation   route was used by both First Nations and early European explorers (e.g., David Thompson and Father De Smet)  as a means to travel along the length of Columbia Lake. Indigenous peoples included  the Spirit Trail as one of their favoured routes to points east of Canal Flats,  namely Whiteswan Lake and into the Kananaskis country.</li>\n  <li>Numerous Traditional Use Sites (TUSs) have been identified   in the park.</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>Conservation</h2>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>The park protects 8% of the considerably under-represented East  Kootenay Trench Ecosection (0.7% protected province wide). Thirteen  protected areas include portions of this ecosection, but only three other parks, Kikomun, Burges  James Gadsden, and Premier Lake exceed the park in representation of the EKT  Ecosection.</li>\n  <li>Columbia Lake Provincial Park contributes close to 9% of protected areas  representation of IDFdm2. This biogeoclimatic subzone/variant lacks notable  representation within the protected area system (0.93%).</li>\n  <li>Known species at risk within the park are Rocky Mountain bighorn  sheep (bluelisted), badger (red-listed), and the great blue  heron (blue-listed).</li>\n  <li>The park retains a significant component of native grasslands and  is integral in supplying winter range for Rocky Mountain bighorn  sheep. The Canada Land Inventory depicts the entire east side of Columbia Lake as  representing the largest contiguous Class 11 ungulate winter range in the Upper Columbia  sub-region, and one of the least impacted of the low elevation Class 1 Rocky  Mountain bighorn sheep winter ranges in British Columbia.</li>\n  <li>The park provides over-wintering habitat for a significant amount  of Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep from Kootenay National Park.</li>\n  <li>Adjacent wildlife management areas protect large and contiguous natural  areas that help maintain biodiversity associated with the wetland and grassland habitats of the much smaller Columbia Lake Provincial Park. For example,  the adjacent Columbia Wetlands Wildlife Management Area supports habitat for  numerous avian, reptilian, mammalian and insect species, many of which are becoming  increasingly rare or endangered. In addition, the Columbia Wetlands  retain one of the last intact portions of the Pacific flyway in western North  America, a key migratory route for waterfowl.</li>\n  <li>In the global context, wetland ecosystems are extremely susceptible  to environmental degradation because they are both difficult  to replace or restore and have been subject to human alteration over the last hundred years.</li>\n  <li>The ecosystem in and around Columbia Lake provides good to excellent  habitat for a variety of fish species (e.g., mountain whitefish, burbot, kokanee, rainbow trout, cutthroat trout, bull trout, peamouth chubb, Northern Pikeminnow,  large-scale sucker, redside shiner, sunfish and longnose sucker).</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>Wildlife</h2>\n<p></p>",

A junction 1.3 km from the Trailhead offers visitors the opportunity  to travel upstream toward August Creek, or downstream toward the  Randy Stoltmann Commemorative Grove.\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Coast Tower:\n    </strong>Length 1.2 km. Average one-way hiking time: 20 minutes from  the Trailhead. This  easy day hike on a maintained gravel trail  brings hikers to the Coast Tower, a massive Sitka spruce  located at the base of the trail leading in the lower Carmanah  Creek  Valley. This giant tree used to be 92 metres in height until  the top 30  metres blew off in winter storms  in 1997. A viewing platform is located at the Coast Tower,  which is the first big spruce you come across in the Valley.\n    <strong>Note</strong>: The viewing platform is closed due to public safety reasons.</li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Junction:</strong>\n    Length 1.3 km. Average one-way hiking time: 25 minutes. From  the parking lot, this is the junction of the trail. From  here hikers can head upstream or downstream. Turn left to go  to the  Upper Valley Trail, which heads toward Three Sisters, Grunts  Grove, Paradise Pool and August Creek. Turn right to head downstream  toward  Heaven Tree and the Randy Stoltmann Commemorative Grove.</li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Three Sisters:</strong>\n    Length 1.5 km. Average one-way hiking time: 40 minutes upstream from the Junction. An elevated viewing platform at Three Sisters provides visitors with a unique perspective of three breathtaking Sitka spruce trees, two which remain standing and one that fell naturally during the winter of 2018/19. These trees are approximately 78-79 metres high. Wilderness camping is allowed here on the large sandbar beside Carmanah Creek. A pit toilet is located here as well. The boardwalk portions of the trail end after Three Sisters.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Grunt’s Grove:</strong>\n    (Please note that the trail is not maintained beyond Three Sisters.) Length 4 km. Average one-way  hiking time: 1.25 hours from the Junction. Continue past Three  Sisters  to Grunts  Grove,  where you will find a majestic stand of Sitka spruce with  adjacent camping on gravel bars. A great number of spruce  seedlings  can be found growing on the sandbars, which is where spruce  trees  typically start their life in Carmanah. There are also  some large logjams  on the creek near Grunts Grove. There are no pit toilets here.</li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Paradise Pool:\n    </strong>(Please note that the trail is not maintained beyond Three Sisters.) Length 5.5  km. Average one-way hiking time: 2 hours from the Junction. Paradise  Pool is a small crystal  clear  pool  where the creek drops slightly. The clear waters are  home to tiny Cutthroat trout and the occasional crayfish. Cougar  tracks  can  often be seen in the mud on the trail where a cougar  has  come down to drink the cool fresh water. The pool is  quite deep  in places  and has a nice sandy bottom. It might look like a nice  place to swim, however the water in Carmanah is very  cold - even  in the  hottest and driest of summers.</li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>August Creek:</strong>\n    (Please note that the trail is not maintained beyond Three Sisters.) Length 7.5  km. Average one-way hiking time: 3.5 hours from the Junction.  August Creek is a small  intact watershed  that  flows into Carmanah from a high reverse valley. It  is the largest creek that flows into Carmanah. Backcountry  camping  opportunities  exist on the sandbar just downstream of the confluence  of August and Carmanah Creek. There are no pit toilets  here.  This is  the most upstream campsite in the valley; maintained  trails end at  August Creek.</li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Heaven Tree:\n    </strong>Length 1.0 km. Average one-way  hiking time: 30 minutes downstream from the Junction. This impressive  Sitka  spruce  is approximately 77 metres tall and is one of the  broadest spruce  trees in the Valley  with a diameter of 3.5 metres.</li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Randy Stoltmann Commemorative  Grove:</strong>\n    (Formerly Heaven Grove) Length 1.3 km. Average one-way hiking time: 50 minutes  downstream from the Junction.  The impressive  stand of Sitka spruce trees in this grove range  in size from approximately 75 – 89 metres in height.  These trees all compete for light and are growing  tall as they reach for the sun. A kiosk at this  site offers information about the Carmanah and  Randy Stoltmann.

On a trek to Carmanah in 1988  Randy and a friend discovered the “legendary giants” of  the Carmanah Valley and brought international recognition to  the plight of the rare ancient trees, which were scheduled for  logging. In 1990, Randy’s tireless work resulted in the creation  of Carmanah Pacific Provincial Park. Today the Walbran and the  upper Carmanah Valleys have been added and Randy’s dream became  complete. The park was then renamed Carmanah Walbran Provincial  Park.\n</p>\n<a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>Cultural Heritage</h2>\n<p></p>\n<a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>Conservation</h2>\n<p>\n  Climate, topography,  geology and other environmental factors have shaped a tremendously  complex and productive ecosystem. The orientation  and relief of the valleys result in a very wet climate for much  of the year. Weather systems approaching Vancouver Island are funneled  by the valleys and result in heavy downpours. Periodically, the  upper watershed has a snow pack.<br>\n  <br>Old-growth  forests consist of trees of a variety of species and age, a mix  that is only possible  in a forest that has been undisturbed  for hundreds of years.  As old trees die and fall over, they are replaced by younger ones that grow  beneath the canopy. Dead and dying trees are essential in old-growth  systems for the  habitat and nourishment they provide. The death of a forest giant means the  beginning of new life for many organisms over a long period of  time. Initially, thick moss  often builds up, helping to retain moisture. Micro-organisms are quick to attack  the dead tree and begin to soften the wood. Bark beetles chew their way in,  introducing fungal spores and bacteria which secrete wood-digesting  chemicals. Attracted  by fermenting sap, ants tunnel in. A multitude of invaders such as mites, termites,  sow bugs, centipedes and salamanders enter. Black bears and raccoons use their  sharp claws to grub for dinner. If the tree remains standing, woodpeckers begin  hunting the insect hordes inside, inadvertently creating cavities that become  nesting sites for a variety of forest birds, bats and other cavity users.<br>\n  <br>The  openness created by fallen trees and their high acidity and  water content provides an ideal growing site for hemlock seedlings  and huckleberry. Hemlock  roots, like grasping arms, extend around the “nurse log” as they  reach for the soil below. All of the nutrients stored in these logs are eventually  released and made available to plants and animals in forms they can use. In  this  way, the energy of the forest is recycled and nothing is wasted.\n</p>\n<a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>Wildlife</h2>\n<p>\n  Carmanah Walbran abounds in wildlife. Mammals that live in the  park include squirrels, mice, voles, martens, raccoons, black-tailed  deer, wolves, cougars and black bears. Bird species include the  Hair and Pileated woodpecker, northern flicker, red-breasted sapsucker,  winter wren, varied thrush, pigmy owl and the Marbled Murrelet.  The lower reaches of Carmanah Creek and Walbran Creek support coho  and Chinook salmon, steelhead, trout, sea-run Cutthroat and sculpins,  while the upper reaches contain small resident Cutthroat trout.\n</p>",

The area’s sheltered waters and rich ocean life  was the breadbasket for a number of First Nation peoples who developed  clam terraces and villages in the area. The remains of these are  still visible today. Park visitors can easily see the large clam  and mussel shell deposits that make up the midden sites and the  experienced eye may spot culturally modified trees (CMTs) or the  park’s petroglyph, located on a rock wall on the north side  of Berry Island. Near the petroglyph you will see a rock formation  known as the “Chief’s Bathtub”, which is a natural  rock basin that fills at high tide. Folklore has it that the local  native chief would bath in this rock basin in water that been warmed  with hot stones taken from a nearby fire.\n  <br>\n  <br>In the late 19th century and early 20th century, this area saw  some settlement by Europeans and there are still signs of their  activities and presence, including overgrown homesteads.\n</p>\n<a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"conserve\" href=\"/\"></a>Conservation</h2>\n<p>Broughton Archipelago  contains a rare combination or marine and terrestrial values, which  makes a significant contribution to the Provincial Protected Area  system. The park contains one of the most under-represented terrestrial  ecosystems in the province - the Outer Fiordland Ecosection Coastal  Western Hemlock very wet maritime submontane variant. Currently only  1.3% of this ecosystem is protected in BC. One of only three protected  areas with this ecosection, the Broughton Archipelago contains 63%  of the protected examples. This gives it a critical role in the system  as a representative of the protected and exposed marine ecosystems.</p>\n<a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>Wildlife</h2>\n<p>\n  Broughton Archipelago contains a number of unique natural values.  Several species of marine mammals, including Orcas (killer whales),  harbour seals, harbour porpoises, sea lions and sea otters utilize  habitats found in this Protected Area. River otters, mink and raccoons  can often be seen playing along the shoreline, coastal black-tailed  deer are commonplace on these islands, and black bears can occasionally  be spotted rolling boulders on the shore in search of food. Bald  eagles are common within the park boundaries as are many other  seabirds, such as Harlequin ducks, cormorants and Great Blue Herons.  Most species of salmon can be also found in the area.<br>\n  <br>For those wishing to  view Orcas in their natural habitat, the best opportunities within  this park are along its western boundaries.  Boaters or kayakers frequenting this area may also see Humpback  or Minke whales. Smaller species like porpoises and dolphins may  also be seen throughout the park, and there are several sea lion  haul-outs within the Broughton Archipelago’s boundaries.\n  <br>\n  <br>Many of these species  are easily disturbed by the close proximity of kayaks and other  vessels. As a general rule of thumb, vessels  should not approach closer than 100 metres to these wildlife species.  With seals and sea lions on shore, vessel operators should ensure  they do not force the animal into the water. Every time a sea lion  or seal is forced into the water it loses body temperature and  energy; repeated incidents can endanger the animals’ health.\n  <br>\n  <br>When in the vicinity  of seals and sea lions basking on shore, vessel operators should  be very aware of the state of the animals’ behaviour.  If the animals seem agitated or disturbed (rocking back and forth,  making growling or barking sounds) back your vessel away and leave.\n</p>",

Park visitors should be aware that Chilko Lake   supports multiple recreational uses. Boaters should always exercise   caution to ensure the safety of all users. Motorized craft are not   permitted on the lagoons. These areas are open to paddle boats only.\n<br>\n<br>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"fishing\" href=\"/\"></a>Fishing</h2>\n<p>\n  <img src=\"ts.jpg\" alt=\"photo of Chilko Lake in Ts'yl-os\" class=\"legacy-image\">\n</p>\n<img src=\"ts2.jpg\" alt=\"photo of a happy child fishing in Ts'yl-os\" class=\"legacy-image\">\nChilko Lake   provides high-quality angling opportunities, and is one of the leading   large-lake fishery resources in the Cariboo Chilcotin. The lake   has long been recognized as a producer of bull-trout and rainbow   trout, and has gained recognition for its spectacular scenery and   high catch success of native sport fish.\n<br>\n<br>Chilko Lake   supports rainbow trout, bull trout, and productive spawning areas   for chinook and sockeye salmon. Bull-trout, a blue-listed species,   is late-maturing and doesn’t spawn until after its sixth year. As   an aggressive feeder, the species is also fairly easy to catch.   These two traits, combined with the difficulty in accurately inventorying   stocks, make the bull-trout susceptible to over-harvesting. The   species’ slow growth and late maturity could result in a recovery   period as long as 20 years. BC Parks is taking a conservative approach   to managing fish stocks in the park. Respect gear restrictions and   lowered catch limits on bull-trout. Anglers are encouraged to carefully   release fish whenever possible.<br>\n<br>The Chilko River   is similarly highly regarded for its fisheries values, and recognized   as one of the leading wilderness trout rivers in the west Chilcotin.   The river supports spawning and rearing habitat for resident rainbow   trout, bull trout, Rocky Mountain whitefish, and steelhead trout.   The Chilko River is a classified water. This means that a Classified   Waters licence must be purchased before fishing in the river. To   conserve stocks, the current regulations on the river include single   barbless hooks, flyfishing only, a bait ban, and a catch-and-release   policy.\n<br>\n<br>Return to\n<a href=\"./\" class=\"legacy-link\">Ts’ilʔos   Provincial Park</a>",

The park contains historical evidence such as archaeological   and burial sites, and areas where traditional uses such as hunting,   trapping, food and medicine gathering still occur. Very little information   about these resources has been recorded, although a lot is known   verbally through the elders. No extensive archaeological assessment   has been undertaken in the park, although a heritage overview, directed   by the Xeni Gwet’in has been completed.<br>\n  <br>Ts’ilʔos, the   imposing peak also known as Mount Tatlow that dominates the park   and gives it its name, is spiritually significant to the Xeni Gwet’in,   and is celebrated in the\n  <a href=\"legend\" class=\"legacy-link\">legend of Ts’ilʔos</a>.   According to native tradition, Ts’ilʔos keeps watch over the people   of the Xeni and their territory. Pointing at or climbing Ts’ilʔos   are considered disrespectful, and the Xeni Gwet’in believe that   doing so will offend Ts’ilʔos, resulting in severe weather changes.   Please respect their beliefs by not pointing at or climbing the   mountain.\n</p>\n<a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>Cultural Heritage</h2>\n<p></p>\n<a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>Conservation</h2>\n<p>\n  Ts’ilʔos Provincial  Park is located in an ecologically significant area in BC. It  is located in a transition zone where plant life changes from dry  interior species to coastal plain species. Because the park is  situated atop the juncture of several ecosystems, it offers a great diversity  of landscapes.<br>\n  <br>The special   features of Ts’ilʔos include, most notably, Chilko Lake and Ts’ilʔos,  or Mount Tatlow. Chilko Lake, the largest natural high elevation  lake in Canada, is an outstanding park feature, with its distinctive  blue waters, lagoons, surrounding volcanic dyke formations, and  mountainous backdrop. Ts’ilʔos is the highest point in the Chilcotin   Range; its spiritual significance is celebrated in a Xeni legend.   Other special features of the park include numerous river valleys   such as the Yohetta, Edmond Creek, and Tchaikazan Valleys. Five   glaciers are found within the Tchaikazan Valley alone, the largest   of which is the only major glacier on the extreme leeward side of   the Coast Mountains.<br>\n  <br>The park’s diverse   landscapes incorporate glaciers, extensive meadows, outwash plains,   forests, brightly colored mountains, and river valleys. This diverse   landscape protects the habitat of a number of species whose populations   are under pressure from human activities, such as grizzly bear,   bighorn sheep, and wolverine. Chilko Lake and its watershed also   preserve the most annually consistent population of spawning salmon   on all the Fraser River tributaries.\n</p>\n<a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>Wildlife</h2>\n<p>\n  The mountainous   terrain of Ts’ilʔos Provincial Park provides for a diversity of  wildlife habitats ranging from Douglas-fir forests at lower elevations  to dry alpine areas at higher elevations. Wildlife species include  black bear, mule deer, moose, mountain goat, cougar, and beaver.  Ecologically sensitive animal populations found in the area include  California bighorn sheep, grizzly bear, fisher, wolverine, bald  eagle, and amphibian species. The adjacent lands are also important  habitat for Vaux’s swift, Peregrine falcon, and Townsend’s big-eared   bat.<br>\n  <br>Chilko River   and Chilko Lake support significant populations of sockeye, chinook,   bull trout, rainbow trout, and steelhead. Various other streams   and rivers feed the Chilko and Taseko systems, and support whitefish.   In the fall, spawning salmon can be observed struggling up the Chilko   River at the north end of Chilko Lake.\n</p>",

All other routes listed below follow old mining roads that predate the establishment of the park. It should be noted that these are hiking and mountain biking routes rather than maintained trails and that difficult conditions may be encountered. If you are planning to hike or mountain bike, it is important to remember that weather conditions in the summer are highly variable. Although clear skies and sunshine are common, it can snow any day. High winds are frequent and there are often spells of cold, wet weather. Fog can roll in at any time and make route-finding a challenge.\n</p>\n<h2>Brief route descriptions</h2>\n<div>\n  <a href=\"javascript:collapse('trails');\" title=\"collapse all headings\" class=\"legacy-link\">–</a>|<a href=\"javascript:expand('trails');\" title=\"expand all headings\" class=\"legacy-link\">+</a>\n</div>\n<dl>\n  <dt>\n    <h3>Chuck Creek</h3>\n  </dt>\n  <dd>\n    <p>\n      This trail is located roughly 141 kilometres south of Haines Junction on the Haines Highway. There is a pull out at the trail head with an outhouse and information kiosk. This trail is great for both hiking and mountain biking. It is recommended that visitors obtain the correct 1:50,000 scale map for this trip (# 114 P/10 – Nadahini Creek).\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      This trail is moderate in difficulty. &nbsp;It is 9km long one way to the end of the maintained trail. It is\n      <strong>highly</strong>\n      recommended to take a GPS reading if you are intending to leave the maintained trail. It can be difficult or impossible to find it again when visibility is poor.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The trail starts in a wide, open sub-alpine valley, with mountainous vistas in all directions. There are several large ditches where road culverts use to be. If you are enjoying this trail by mountain bike, please stay on the main trail at all times to avoid damaging the surrounding vegetation.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      After roughly three kilometres, Mineral Lakes will come into view to your left. If you decide to continue further along this trail you will come across Chuck Creek. At this location a shallow water crossing is required, so you may wish to have additional footwear such as sandals with you. The rocks on the bottom of the creek are slippery and sometimes sharp, so be careful when crossing.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      At approximately seven kilometre point into this trip, the trail drops down to Clear Creek where another shallow water crossing is required. At this location the Samuel Glacier will be greeting you with its spectacular scenery. The trail becomes indistinct from here as it continues to a large gravel outwash. After another 2kms the trail ends in an open meadow.\n    </p>\n  </dd>\n  <dt>\n    <h3>\n      Parton River\n    </h3>\n  </dt>\n  <dd>\n    <p>\n      This abandoned access road/horse trail is located roughly 112 kilometres   south of Haines Junction on the Haines Highway, just past   Stanley Creek. From here take the gravel road that turns off   the highway toward the Tatshenshini River. It is recommended   that visitors obtain the correct 1:50,000 scale maps for this   trip (# 114 P/10 - Nadahini Creek, # 114 P/11 - Carmine Mountain   and # 114 P/15 - Parton River). Park your vehicle at the Tatshenshini   River to begin your journey. This abandoned access road/horse trail is unmaintained and there is no signage at the start of the hike/bike or anywhere along it.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The   Parton River trail leading to Shinny Lakes and the northern   reaches of the O’Conner River begins with crossing the   Tatshenshini River and then the Parton River. The hiking is   good until the first obstacle - a rock slide area. This begins   at UTM coordinates 397020 E / 6639350 N to 396906 E / 6639287   N. This also continues up until 396822 E / 6639150 N. The   rock slide area has two more obstacles at UTM coordinates   396635 E / 6638929 N and 396549 E / 6638102 N. The second   obstacle is known for clogging up mountain bike tires. The   third obstacle has two slides that completely cover the road.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      After   the third obstacle you cross a prominent gully, and then the   hiking becomes better as it follows an old mining road. At   the next creek encountered it is very easy to lose the trail   and end up bushwhacking through a muskeg. Pay attention after   passing the “old wagon” staying to the right fork   away from the Parton River, this will keep you on track. The   hiking is good up to the old cabin by the junction in the   road. The junction is at UTM coordinates 393884 E / 6631715   N.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Going   northwest will put you on the Shinny Lakes trail, which has   spectacular scenery throughout. The trail has good hiking   following the old mining road and horse trail. Mountain biking   is not recommended past the first lake, as the trail is very   narrow and soft. This lake is suitable for swimming because   it has little vegetation and a gravely beach at the east end.   At this point the trail becomes a narrow horse trail.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Back   at the junction, going East across the creek will put you   on the O’Conner Trail, roughly about 16 kilometres,   to an old airstrip. There is a steep climb for about three   kilometres (2 miles). Then it slopes off to the first and   only obstacle - a serious rockslide. This begins at UTM coordinates   394849 E / 6630935 N to 394855 E / 6630880 N which covers   the whole road completely. This slide has a treacherous detour   below and above it. Use extreme caution when hiking around   or over it. After the obstacle there is another steep climb   and then the trail levels off. The trail follows along the   valley below, which provides spectacular scenery. The trail   leads down into the valley and through to the old airstrip.\n    </p>\n  </dd>\n  <dt>\n    <h3>\n      Squaw Range\n    </h3>\n  </dt>\n  <dd>\n    <p>\n      Access to the Squaw Range begins the   same as the Parton River description listed above. When you   reach the west side of the valley, take the right hand fork,   following an old mining road up Goldrun Creek. This road climbs   steeply, traversing the range and ending near Talbot Creek.   To continue this traverse one must route find their way across   the Talbot Creek watershed to meet up with the south end of   old Squaw Creek mining road. This old road will take you in   a northwesterly direction, following Squaw Creek down to the   British Columbia / Yukon border and out of the park.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Along   the way, visitors may notice signs of historic placer mining   activities. It is recommended that visitors obtain the correct   1:50,000 scale map for this trip (# 114 P/10 - Nadahini Creek).\n    </p>\n  </dd>\n  <dt>\n    <h3>\n      Copper Butte\n    </h3>\n  </dt>\n  <dd>\n    <p>\n      This abandoned access road is located roughly 160 kilometres   south of Haines Junction on the Haines Highway – approximately   4 kilometres past Three Guardsmen Lake. Park your vehicle   at Seltat pull off where your hike begins by walking down   the old Haines Road. This abandoned access road is unmaintained and there is no signage at the start of the hike/bike or anywhere along it.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      You   walk roughly 2.5 kilometres down the old Haines Road until   you come to Schulz Creek, which will be the second creek you   encounter. From here you stay right and begin a moderately   strenuous hike through the Alder for about 100m until it opens   up to the old Copper Butte mining road.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      From   the Copper Butte mining road you can follow the road which   leads you right to the old mines. It is a very scenic route   that contains many visible remains left behind from past mining   activities. Once you reach the first plateau the terrain opens   up. You will be greeted with mountainous vistas and get a   bird’s eye view of Inspector Creek.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The   mine on the East facing slope is unstable and in rough shape   and should not be entered for it could be hazardous. Because   the weather is so unpredictable you should carry a jacket   and rain gear with you. You should also bring water and something   to eat. But most importantly enjoy the hike.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Caution:</strong>\n      Do   not attempt to enter any mineshaft. They can be very unstable   and dangerous!<br>\n    </p>\n  </dd>\n</dl>",

      "content": "<img src=\"rafting.jpg\" alt=\"Tatshenshini-Alsek Park\" class=\"legacy-image\">\nIn the early 1970s a few adventurous people started to raft and kayak the Tatshenshini and Alsek Rivers. Their experiences were so moving and exhilarating that many volunteered long hours, working to ensure protection for the area. River use grew slowly at first, but widespread media attention in the late 1980s brought many new people to experience these rivers. By 1994 over 13,600 user nights were spent on the Tatshenshini and Alsek Rivers. This growing use required management.<br>\n<br>Park Managers in Tatshenshini-Alsek Park,\n<a href=\"https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/yt/kluane/visit/tarifs-fees\">Kluane National Park and Reserve</a>\n(Yukon), and\n<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/glba/planyourvisit/permitsandreservations.htm\">Glacier   Bay National Park and Preserve</a>\n(Alaska) work together to manage river use through permitting, similar to other great scenic rivers such as the Colorado. The permit system is being used to help maintain a high quality wilderness experience, to minimize human impact, and to protect natural and cultural values. Half of the permits are available to private parties and the other half are issued to commercial operators. Commercial trips may be booked through various travel agencies, but there is usually a waiting list for private trips.<br>\n<br>Three common river trips in Tatshenshini-Alsek Park are described below. Although rafting on the Tatshenshini and Alsek rivers is not technically difficult, rafters must be aware that the remoteness of this park is an\n<strong>essential\n</strong>factor to consider in trip preparation and safety. The exception to the level of difficulty is Turnback Canyon on the Alsek River, which is\n<strong>extremely</strong>\nhazardous at all water levels and travel is\n<strong>not recommended\n</strong>for even the most skilled rafter/kayaker.<br>\n<br>\n<h3>Upper Tatshenshini River Day Trips:</h3>\n<p>The upper portion of the Tatshenshini River parallels the Haines Highway. Day trips along this stretch of class three water are common, starting at Mosquito Flats in Tatshenshini-Alsek Park in British Columbia and taking out at Shäwshe (Dalton Post) in the Yukon Territory. No permits are required for day trips on this upper portion of river, and no fees are applied.</p>\n<p>Please see the information below on use of the Shäwshe (Dalton Post) take-out.\n</p>\n<h3>Tatshenshini-Alsek River Trips to Dry Bay Alaska:</h3>\n<p>Through trips down the Tatshenshini River and lower Alsek River to Dry Bay Alaska are restricted through a permit system that is currently managed by\n  <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/glba/planyourvisit/permitsandreservations.htm\">Glacier   Bay National Park and Preserve</a>. Dry Bay trips are scheduled and managed under a one-party-a-day take-out rule, including parties coming down the upper Alsek River from Kluane National Park. BC Parks charges fees for these trips, see below.</p>\n<p>Shäwshe (Dalton Post), off the Haines Highway in the Yukon, is the usual put-in for trips down the Tatshenshini -Alsek. From here it is 140 river miles to the normal take-out at Dry Bay, Alaska. A six-mile long canyon immediately below Shäwshe (Dalton Post) offers continuous Class III whitewater, Class IV at high water (International Scale, Class I-VI). The remainder of the river is generally Class II with large eddies and folds at normal volumes. Tatshenshini trips average 6 days on the water, plus additional lay-over days.</p>\n<p>Please see the information below on the use of the Shäwshe (Dalton Post) put in.\n</p>\n<h3>Alsek River Trips:</h3>\n<p>Alsek River trips through Kluane National Park (Yukon Territory) and Tatshenshini-Alsek Park typically start at Haines Junction and put-ins are managed through a permit system with\n  <a href=\"https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/yt/kluane/visit/tarifs-fees\">Kluane National Park</a>. The upper section of the river above Turnback Canyon is Class III. Turnback Canyon is\n  <strong>extremely\n  </strong>\n  hazardous at all water levels and travel is\n  <strong>not recommended\n  </strong>for even the most skilled rafter/kayaker. Some groups chose to fly out of the Alsek River at Turnback Canyon. Groups that chose to continue down the Alsek River will need aircraft assistance to portage Turnback Canyon. Only aircraft companies with a valid park use permit are allowed to conduct flights within Tatshenshini-Alsek Park. Groups that portage and continue through to Dry Bay Alaska must be permitted through Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve. Trips to Dry Bay are scheduled and managed under a one-party-a-day take-out rule, including parties coming down the Tatshenshini River. BC Parks charges fees for these trips, see below.</p>\n<h3>Shäwshe (Dalton Post)\n</h3>\n<p>Champagne and Aishihik First Nations ask all river rafters to please use the designated raft launch point at the Lower Landing site for your trip down the Tatshenshini and Alsek Rivers to Dry Bay, Alaska. The day trip arrivals take-out point is at the Upper Landing. These areas were identified to alleviate conflicts between other interest groups who use Shäwshe/ Dalton Post area.\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"/explore/parkpgs/tatshens/shawshe-dalton-post-put-in-directions.pdf\" class=\"legacy-link\">Shäwshe (Dalton Post) Map</a>\n    [PDF]\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"river_fee\" href=\"/\"></a>BC Parks River Fee and How to Pay It</h2>\n<p>All trips on the Tatshenshini and Alsek Rivers, which end at Dry Bay Alaska, require a permit issued through the\n  <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/glba/planyourvisit/rafting.htm\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. National Park and Preserve</a>.</p>\n<p>You must have an approved non-commercial river permit before paying the BC Parks river rafting fee.

In recent years, BC Parks and the Champagne and Aishihik First   Nations have taken the necessary steps to provide winter recreation   opportunities for those wishing to ride snowmobiles in this   magnificent corner of British Columbia. At the same time, BC   Parks is committed to protecting the natural environment and   preserving wildlife species and their habitat.<br>\n<br>Recent studies   indicate that snowmobile activity does affect a wide variety   of animals, often resulting in behavior alterations, habitat   avoidance, and energy expenditures at critical times when animals   are under extreme stress due to winter hardships. By respecting   wildlife you encounter while riding in the park, you will help   preserve the long-standing value this area provides for wildlife   and their habitat.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Where can you ride in the park?</strong>\n<br>\n<br>Snowmobile use is only allowable in a specified area within the park. The roughly 60,000 hectare, snowmobile area is in the park’s Natural Environment Zone, one of two management zones within the park. The other zone in the park is called the Wilderness Recreation Zone.\n<br>\n<br>The objective   of the Natural Environment Zone is to provide a limited number   of entry points along the Haines Highway where snowmobile use   is permitted. Access is restricted largely to valley bottoms   and valley ridges in this portion of the park.<br>\n<br>Generally   the use of snowmobiles in Provincial Parks is prohibited. BC   Parks has allowed for this activity to continue in Tatshenshini-Alsek   Park providing it is contained within the Natural Environment   Zone and does not negatively impact conservation values. However,   if this objective cannot be achieved, BC Parks will have no   choice other than to consider a complete closure to the use   of snowmobiles in the park.<br>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"/explore/parkpgs/tatshens/tat-snowmobile-boundary.kmz\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"legacy-link\">Google Earth file of the snowmobile boundary</a>\n    [KMZ]</li>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"/explore/parkpgs/tatshens/tat_snowmobile_map.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"legacy-link\">Snowmobile Area Map</a>\n    [PDF]</li>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"/explore/parkpgs/tatshens/tat_snowmobile_brochure_jun17_2005.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"legacy-link\">Snowmobiling Brochure</a>\n    [PDF]</li>\n</ul>\nAdditional considerations:\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Be   Respectful of Others</strong>\n    – Snowmobiles can present   a danger to other park visitors, especially backcountry skiers   and snowboarders.</li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Ride Straight</strong>\n    – Avoid drugs and alcohol until you are completely   finished riding.

The Davie Trail became the main travel route to the Klondike   - a cattle drive of 500-600 head was even attempted along the Davie   Trail from Vanderhoof to the Klondike (ca. 1900). The Kechika River   was also used to transport furs to Lower Post.

There is a moderate amount of deadfall along the   trail. Tread well defined and generally dry, except one short   section in middle. The trail is excellent for hiking but probably   a bit steep for horse use (there may be an alternate route used   by horse riders, since little sign is evident on the trail).<br>\n<br>Please note that this route is not within Todagin South Slope Provincial   Park.<br>\n<br>The trailhead is unmarked; to find it, drive South from Tatogga Lake Resort   approximately 500 metres; you will see a turnoff on the left   (east side of hwy), heading up-hill and angling north. Road   only goes fifty feet or so before ending at a pullout. Trail   continues from this point. There are three tracks visible; take   the middle one (it is the most prominent).<br>\n<br>Trail begins through mixed spruce/aspen forest, with highbush cranberry and   soapberry underbrush. It soon climbs steeply into conifer forest,   spruce increasingly grading to subalpine fir. Trail climbs along   edge of gully; Kimball Creek can be heard to the left. After   about a kilometre, the trail crosses creek and continues climbing   on north bank. The trail is easy to follow, but continuously   steep. About 2 kilometres from the highway, the trail enters   subalpine meadows interspersed with subalpine fir thickets.   You come to a junction where the trail goes left or right; turn   right. Soon after, you come out of the last trees into open   tundra.<br>\n<br>You can climb to the summit that you see to the right (South) for an   excellent view of Kinaskan and Eddontenajon Lakes. If you intend   to travel further across the plateau, it is best to traverse   left (north) around the side of the mountain, since one has   to descend to another valley on the far side of the ridge.<br>\n<br>From the   far side of the peak, one can look east across the headwaters   of Jackson Creek to Todagin Mountain. In the middle distance   is a rocky bluff; keep to the left of this, as a deep ravine   cuts in from the southwest just beyond this.<br>\n<br>Once you   have circled around the eastern edge of this rocky bluff, the   route south towards the park is clearly visible. One can either   stay low, traversing around the head of the deep creek valley   and into a narrow, rocky pass (a small lake is located here).   A decent (though exposed) campsite can be found just on the   far side of this pass. Alternately, one can stay high, climbing   over the ridge which comes down from Todagin Mountain. This   is a more direct route.\n<br>\n<br>Once you   have crossed the ridge, Tsatia Mountain is visible on the other   side of Todagin Creek. Heading directly towards the park from   here isn’t recommended, since you have to drop over 500 feet   into a steep canyon, then climb back up to the plateau on the   other side. Circling around the head of this canyon, to the   East, is further but less difficult. Expect to climb in and   out of a few creek gullies. An old horse camp can be found near   the headwaters of this creek, at UTM 446884 on map sheet 104H   12. There is good water and flat ground throughout this valley.   Once across the creek, the terrain rises gradually to a height   of land punctuated by rocky peaks. The park boundary follows   this height of land, overlooking Todagin Creek. Most of the   park is steep hillside, with only a thin strip of flat plateau   along the northern edge. There is a possible campsite near a   small lake at UTM 433865 on map sheet 104H 12, though this site   is exposed to wind.<br>\n<br>Vegetation   throughout the plateau is alpine steppe dominated by bunchgrasses,   lichens, and bearberry. There is no timber anywhere on the plateau,   except well down into the creek valleys. Water is fairly scarce   in the upland areas of the plateau; fill up your bottles whenever   you have a chance.<br>\n<br>There is   excellent sheep habitat all along the route: grassy meadows   with easy access to escape terrain in the gullies. There are   many well-defined sheep trails through here and abundant sheep   sign.<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"./\" class=\"legacy-link\">Return   to Todagin Provincial Park</a>",

Purchase of the property and establishment of the park occurred in response to the opportunity to preserve public access to this recreational fishing site, on a stretch of shoreline where such riverfront access is in short supply.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  The 99 hectare Class A Park was established under the Protected Areas of British Columbia Act, Bill 24-2007, in May 2007.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  The property was originally Crown Granted to Thomas Crosby, a Methodist missionary whom settled in the area, in 1897. Since that time the property had numerous owners and uses. In the 1920’s the open meadows were used for landing airplanes and in 1922 the site was the first registered airfield in BC.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  The park is directly adjacent to the site of a former bridge across the Bulkley River that connected South Hazelton and the Village of Hazelton. Anderson Flats has an established history of use by Bulkley, Skeena, and Kispiox River Valley residents and visitors to the area. The undeveloped property has been a recreational fishing and camping destination for many years.<br>\n</p>\n<a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>Cultural Heritage</h2>\n<p>The area is said to have been used since time immemorial as a trading place. The floodplain was the site of yearly trading fairs, where traders from the Gitxsan, Haida, Tlingit, Nisga’a, Tsetaut, Kitimaat, Babine, Wet’suwet’en and other nations met to exchange products of the interior for those of the coast, share ideas and enjoy games together.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  Anderson Flats Park is within the asserted traditional territory of the Gitxsan First Nation (People of the River of Mist) and is identified as Lax Lit Hetwit House territory. The park is located across the Bulkley River from Gitanmaax Indian Reserve 1 and the cultural interpretation/museum/campground facility of ’Ksan.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  The site was known to be formerly a Gitxsan harvesting site for berries and other medicinal and food plants.&nbsp; Given the soils and vegetation in the park, it is likely that burning was done to promote shrubs such as hazelnut, saskatoon, cherries, hawthorn, thimbleberry and highbush-cranberry, all of which are important Gitxsan food plants. As well most of these biologically rich meadows were either created or maintained by aboriginal burning, and support important traditional food and medicinal plants such as cow parsnip, fireweed, chocolate lily and marsh valerian. Prescribed burning was carried out every ten years or so to promote growth and abundance of berry bushes.\n  <br>\n  <br>Several traditional Gitxsan net fishing sites are located upstream of Anderson Flats on the Bulkley River as well as the Wet’suwet’en village of Tse-kya at Hagwilget Canyon.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  No archaeological sites are formally registered with the provincial Archaeological Branch.\n</p>\n<a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>Conservation</h2>\n<p>\n  Anderson Flats Park (210 - 300m elevation) lies at the epicentre of a broad ecological transition zone (ecotone) between two different climate classifications. These include the cool, wet rainforests of the northern BC Coast and the drier, colder sub-boreal forests of the north central Interior.&nbsp; This transition contributes to the rich diversity of the park. The transition zone has many unique ecosystems and is home to many organisms that are genetically intermediate between closely-related coastal and interior species, subspecies and varieties that were separated during periods of glaciation and are now interbreeding in the Skeena River valley. The best known example is Roche spruce, a hybrid between coastal Sitka spruce and interior white or white x Engelmann spruce. There are many less studied plants and animals that also appear to show introgression between coastal, interior and boreal forms in the Hazelton area.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  However, due to its long history of use, the natural environment of Anderson Flats has been considerably altered.<br>\n  <br>\n  Anderson Flats Park protects 82 hectares of the Cranberry Upland (CRU) ecosection. Currently &lt; 0.5% of this ecosection is protected provincially. The park also provides protection for a remnant portion of underrepresented Interior Cedar – Hemlock, Hazelton Moist Cold (ICH mc2) biogeoclimatic variant in the Cranberry Upland Ecosection, including an area of river valley floodplain. Only 4% of this Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification (BEC) variant is protected provincially.\n  <br>\n  <br>Two blue-listed ecological communities are found in the park which include the Mountain alder, red osier, dogwood, lady fern (ICHmc2/Fl02) occupying ~.8 ha. and the Hybrid white (Roche) spruce, paper birch, devil’s club (ICHmc2/$54) covering ~14 ha.<br>\n  <br>Four vascular plant species that are uncommon to rare in northwestern BC which have been noted to occur in Anderson Flats Park and are considered to be regionally significant include grooved agrimony (Agrimonia striata), ostrich fern (Matteucia struthiopteris), black sanicle (Sanicula marilandica) and silver burweed (Ambrosia chamissonis).\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  Anderson Flats Park plays a significant role in conservation and preservation of provincially and regionally significant fish values associated with the Skeena and Bulkley Rivers. These two rivers are both Class II waters. This provincial designation is indicative of highly productive streams that are carefully managed to preserve unique fishing opportunities. Both rivers contribute significantly to the province’s reputation as a world class fishing destination.\n  <br>\n  <br>The park also includes a section of the Bulkley River floodplain, which is not represented elsewhere in the provincial park system.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  Anderson Flats Park is located directly across the Skeena River from Bulkley Junction Park. This contiguity with Bulkley Junction Park secures public access to river frontage and provides protection for the riparian areas on both shores of the Skeena River, while also preserving scenic values for both parks.</p>\n<a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>Wildlife</h2>\n<p>The Skeena and Bulkley Rivers provide provincially significant spawning and rearing habitat for steelhead, chinook, pink, coho, sockeye and chum salmon. All these species migrate past this park. Deeper pools adjacent to park provide rearing and over-wintering fish habitat for steelhead, rainbow, bulltrout and cutthroat trout.<br>\n  <br>\n  Wildlife observed in the park includes black bear, grizzly bear, moose, coyotes, wolves, marten, otter, beaver, bald eagles and many other bird species.\n</p>",

The Heiltsuk people were among the  first to inhabit this area. Heiltsuk place names such as Hakai  (“wide passage”), Namu (“whirlwind”)  and Koeye (“sitting on water”) are reminders of this  earlier habitation, as are such physical remnants as shell middens,  fish traps, and canoe haulouts.\n</p>\n<a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>Cultural   Heritage</h2>\n<p>\n  Heiltsuk oral  tradition states that the original Heiltsuk ancestors were set  down by the Creator in various areas in the territory now referred  to as the Central Coast of British Columbia, before the time  of the great flood.\n  <br>\n  <br>The Heiltsuk  people lived in many villages and seasonal camp locations throughout  Heiltsuk territory. There were a number of tribal groups that  lived in areas of Heiltsuk territory for millennia.\n</p>\n<a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>Conservation</h2>\n<p>\n  The dramatic  contrast between marine and terrestrial landscapes make the Hakai  Lúxvbálís Conservancy special within the BC Provincial Park  system. The area includes some of the most varied and scenic  coastline in the province with special features including lagoons,  reversing tidal rapids and beaches.\n  <br>\n  <br>The diversity  of habitats within Hakai Lúxvbálís Conservancy results in  a great wealth of flora and fauna. The intertidal waters are  home to an amazing number of marine life forms whose lives and  activities are controlled by the rhythmic movements of the tides.  Every rock pool has its own distinctive inhabitants: mollusca,  crabs, starfish, anemones, sea urchins and many others.\n</p>\n<a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>Wildlife</h2>\n<p>\n  The offshore  waters at Hakai are home to orca, minke, grey and humpback whales,  as well as sea lions, seals, porpoises and dolphins. Orcas and  Pacific white-sided dolphins are frequently seen as they cruise  the waters of Hakai Pass. Grey whales may be spotted feeding  in shallow bays while harbour seals are abundant and may be observed  anywhere and at any time.\n  <br>\n  <br>Over 100 species  of birds have been identified in the Hakai Lúxvbálís Conservancy.  Bald eagles are common. Hosts of sandpipers, plovers and other  shore birds feed busily along the beaches and tidal flats. Feeding  flocks of gulls, auklets, murres and murrelets are numerous in  the waters of Kildidt and Queens Sounds. Black oyster catchers,  pelagic cormorants, surf birds and both black and ruddy turnstones  are also common. Black-tailed deer and wolves are very common.  Due to the dense forest growth they are most likely to be seen  on the beaches or swimming between islands. River otters and  mink are sighted frequently along the shoreline. Other mammal  inhabitants of the islands are beavers and black bears.\n</p>",

This park contains  the first campground built on Vancouver Island since the early 1980s, created  in partnership with Forest Renewal BC (FRBC), the Cowichan Lake Community  Forest Co-operative (CLCFC) and IWA. FRBC funded the project and CLCFC provided  labour by hiring displaced forest workers from IWA local 1-80.\n</p>\n<a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>Cultural Heritage</h2>\n<p>\n  Cowichan,  from the Coast Salish word “Khowutzun” meaning “land  warmed by the sun,” is an area rich in First Nations, European and  resource history.<br>\n  <br>\n  The Cowichan  Valley has been home to the Cowichan Tribes from the earliest  times. Cowichan is a collective name for a number of villages on eastern  Vancouver Island,  including Comiaken, Somenos, Koksilah and Quamichan. Today the Cowichan  tribes make up the largest band in British Columbia and members  of the band own  and reside on much of the land surrounding Duncan and the Cowichan River.<br>\n  <br>The  first European settlers to the region arrived in 1862. Agriculture  dominated the early colonial years. Mining replaced agriculture as the  primary industry  as the forested interior regions became more widely traveled, however  it was the forest industry that had the greatest influence on  development  and settlement  in the region. Most of the old-growth forest in the area was logged early  in the 20th century, and forestry activities continue to this day.<br>\n  <br>Since  the early 1900s the river has served as a transportation corridor  to Lake Cowichan for local logging operations. Old spring board stumps  and remnants of camps and rail lines testify to the area’s important logging history.\n</p>\n<a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>Conservation</h2>\n<p>The  Cowichan River is internationally known for its highly valuable and  productive fish habitat. Species include coho, Chinook and chum salmon,  steelhead and rainbow, brown and Cutthroat trout. The park also protects  representative Douglas fir and Western hemlock forest communities  and rare wildflowers.</p>\n<a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>Wildlife</h2>\n<p>\n  The area is known to provide habitat for many species of birds and wildlife.  Small mammals found in the park include shrews, voles, bats and the native  red squirrel. Raccoons, mink, martens and weasels are also common, and river  otters and beavers inhabit the river. The native Vancouver Island ermine, a  blue-listed species, has also been found in the park. Larger mammals include  black bears, which can be seen in the park during salmon spawning, as well  as cougars, black-tailed deer and Roosevelt elk.<br>\n  <br>The Cowichan Valley sustains thousands of birds of at least 200 different  species. Species resident to the park include osprey, hawks, owls, ravens and  crows as well as many species of songbirds. Bald eagles can be seen along the  river in late fall and winter.\n</p>",

In 1967, the Northern Recreation   Survey identified the Dall and Denetiah Lakes, as an area possessing   outstanding recreational value situated in remote wilderness of   stunning beauty. Recreation reserves were established around Denetiah   and Dall Lakes in 1968 and 1970. The area was included as an Area   of Interest (AOI) to the Protected Area Strategy in 1994. The Fort   Nelson Land and Resource Management Plan (1997) later confirmed   the importance of protected status for this area.\n</p>\n<a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>Cultural   Heritage</h2>\n<p>\n  Denetiah Park   falls within the traditional territory of the Kaska Dena and Tahltan   First Nations. Although there is limited documented information,   the area has high potential for cultural and heritage resources.<br>\n  <br>Modern man’s   history within Denetiah is characterized by long-term trapping and   prospecting and brief periods of gold mining. Other important historical   events include the development of the Davie Trail which was the   main travel route to the Klondike, a cattle drive of 500-600 head   along the Davie Trail from Vanderhoof to the Klondike (ca. 1900)   and the use of the Kechika River to transport furs to Lower Post.   An advance party from the Bedaux expedition (1934) that attempted   to establish an east-west route through the Northern Rocky Mountains   crossed the Rocky Mountains at Sifton Pass and may have travelled   through the area on route to Telegraph Creek.\n</p>\n<a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>Conservation</h2>\n<p>\n  Denetiah Park   provides representation of the Kechika Mountains and Cassiar Ranges   ecosections. The area is characterized by moderate relief with long,   thin lakes and boreal forest situated in wide, U-shaped valleys.   Lakes have sand-pebble beaches. Peaks and glaciers have been sharply   carved by glaciers, of which only a few small ones remain. Extensive   areas of contiguous alpine areas cover the high areas. Mountains   from the western portion of the park are from the Stikine Ranges,   those in the middle represent the Kechika Ranges and mountains east   of the Kechika River are located in the Muskwa Ranges.<br>\n  <br>The Kechika   Ranges are composed largely of Precambrian and Paleozoic sedimentary   rocks that have been carved and shaped by glaciation. Exposures   of Precambrian age rocks, and quartzite, pebble, conglomerate, siltstone,   slate and shale of Lower Cambrian age are found in cliffs that surround   Denetiah and Dall lakes. The advance of the last ice-sheet in a   northeast direction deposited glacial erractics south of Denetiah   Lake. Denetiah Lake was first created by a valley glacier and then   later partially filled in and dammed by glacial debris. There is   high geological and mineral variety around Denetiah Lake and quartz   sand beach lies at its southwestern end.<br>\n  <br>\n  Denetiah and   Dall Lakes are the main hydrological features. The Kechika River   was designated as a BC Heritage River in 1996 for its outstanding   ecological and wilderness recreation values. All drainages in the   park drain into the Liard River and via the Mackenzie River into   the Arctic Ocean. Denetiah Park falls within a large undeveloped   watershed that includes the Turnagain and Kechika Rivers and all   of their tributaries; it is the largest unroaded and undeveloped   watershed south of 60 degrees latitude in BC.<br>\n  <br>Three biogeoclimatic   zones occur within this wilderness park. The Boreal White and Black   Spruce zone is found in the valleys of the Kechika and Dall Rivers.   The Spruce Willow Birch zone is located at higher elevation along   Denetiah Creek and the Alpine Tundra zone is found at the highest   elevations.\n</p>\n<a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>Wildlife</h2>\n<p>\n  A variety of   wildlife inhabits this northern mountain landscape. The area provides   high quality habitat for moose, caribou, stone sheep and mountain   goat. The abundance of prey supports predator species such as wolves   and grizzly and black bears. The best stone sheep habitat in the   world is located immediately north and south of Denetiah Park.<br>\n  <br>The Rocky Mountain   Trench is an important migration corridor for many bird species,   especially waterfowl. There are staging and nesting areas for swans.<br>\n  <br>Fish inventories   in Dall Lake have identified bull trout, lake trout, lake whitefish,   northern pike, dolly varden, arctic grayling, round whitefish, long   nose sucker and slimy sculpin. Denetiah Lake has mountain whitefish, long   nose sucker, slimy sculpin and rainbow trout. Dall and Denetiah   are low productivity lakes, with fish exhibiting slow growth and   late maturation. As a result, fish populations are easily overfished.   Please be prudent and refer to the current BC Environment Fishing   Regulations Synopsis. Anglers can fish for arctic grayling, bull   trout and whitefish in the Kechika River.\n</p>",

Motorized access along the Sikanni River trail does not extend into   the park. Primitive campsites are found along both trails. There   are approximately 26 sites along the Redfern Lake trail, of which   seven are located within the park.<br>\n<br>\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"ethics\" href=\"/\"></a>Leave   No Trace, (some special notes for horse users):</h3>\nThe seven principles   of “<a href=\"https://leavenotrace.ca/\">Leave No Trace</a>” Ethics have been adapted for use by horse riders   at Redfern-Keily Provincial Park. These guidelines will help you   plan your visit so that you can minimize your impact upon the environment   and keep Redfern-Keily Provincial Park accessible to riders in years   to come.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Plan Ahead and Prepare:</strong>\n<br>\nReduce the impact by limiting your equipment and by taking only   the minimum number of animals necessary. Take only experienced and   fit horses. Practice backcountry packing and travel techniques with   your horses at home before heading out.<br>\n<br>Ensure group   members have compatible expectations. Plan your route carefully.   Familiarize yourselves with the regulations, potential hazards,   and climate of the area. Plan meals accurately, and repackage into   reusable containers to reduce weight and potential garbage. Pack   out what you pack in.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Concentrate Use in Resistant Areas:\n</strong>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Camping:\n    </strong>\n    <br>The heaviest   impact will tend to be around camp, so it is best to choose   a campsite that can “take it”. When selecting a backcountry   campsite, please choose one that appears established, to avoid   proliferation of new impacts. Camp well away from water sources.   Avoid places where impact is just beginning. Hard sand or gravel   surfaces are the best.\n    <br>\n    <br>Use lightweight   camping equipment - fewer packhorses will be needed and there   will be less impact on the ground.<br>\n    <br>You can   take a horse to water but you can’t make it drink, so take the   water to the horse instead using a canvas bucket. Wetlands and   creek edges are very important wildlife areas and quite susceptible   to trampling, so keep horses away except when fording.</li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Travel</strong>\n    <br>\n    If you encounter   muddy areas, please go straight through them. Riding around   the edges just increases the extent of the mud bog. Off trail   travel should be done along well established game trails or   along established routes.<br>\n    <br>During rest   breaks, please stop off the trail on a durable surface. Horses   may be tied to sturdy trees for short periods; please wrap lead   rope twice around the trunk to avoid girdling the tree. Tend   to the horses often, as a distraught horse can quickly damage   tree roots by pawing or trampling the ground. Tie and hobble   restless stock to prevent pawing.</li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Pack It In, Pack It Out</strong>\n    <br>\n    Pack out   all your own litter, and if you see litter left by others,   consider bringing that out, too. Reduce the amount of garbage   you generate by pre-planning and repackaging meals into daily   rations. Only paper may be burned in your campfire. Don’t   burn laminated foil or plastics, they leave a residue and   can attract bears. (<a href=\"/explore/misc/bears/bearsaf.html\" class=\"legacy-link\">For information on bear safety in provincial   parks, click here</a>.)</li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Properly Dispose of What You Can’t Pack Out</strong>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Human Waste</strong>\n        <br>\n        Besides being disgusting, raw human feces can carry a number   of dangerous pathogens, Giardia, the cause of Beaver Fever,   (link to Beaver Fever Page) being only one. Proper disposal   is very important. Never use streams or lakes as sewers! Use   outhouses where they are provided. Otherwise dig a cat-hole   latrine for your group to use. Locate it at least 100m (300ft)   from water and well away from camp. It should be a trench   15 cm (6”) deep - no deeper because the topsoil is where   waste is most quickly decomposed. Sprinkle soil over after   each use, and when leaving camp, replace remaining soil and   naturalize it with organic debris.</li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Waste Water</strong>\n        <br>\n        It is important to prevent contamination of water supplies   from food scraps or soap. Wash yourself and your dishes and   clothes at least 100m from water sources. Avoid using even   biodegradable soap as it leaves unnatural residues. Strain   out food particles from dishwater and pack them out with the   garbage. Dig a sump hole down to mineral soil and pour grey   water into it. Fill in and conceal the hole on leaving camp.</li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Hunting Waste</strong>\n        <br>\n        Gut piles and hides should be left well away from campsites   and trails, as they will attract scavengers such as ravens,   coyotes and bears.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Use Fire Responsibly</strong>\n    <br>\n    For cooking,   portable stoves are far better than the traditional campfire   - more efficient, quicker, safer and controllable. They are   recommended as the best “<a href=\"https://leavenotrace.ca/\">Leave No Trace</a>” solution. However,   there’s nothing like the crackle of a welcoming evening campfire.   Ordinarily, campfires are permitted in established fire rings.   In backcountry areas, collect dead and down wood only. Never   burn waste other than paper. Extinguish the fire completely   before you leave camp. You should be able to put your hand   in the ashes and feel no warmth.</li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Leave What You Find</strong>\n    <br>\n    Let others   experience the same sense of discovery you had upon finding   interesting objects like shed antlers, colourful rocks, wildflowers,   old buildings, etc. Leave things where you found them. It   is illegal to remove or disturb such things.<br>\n    <br>Also,   avoid damage to live trees and plants. Don’t cut them for   any reason. Bring along lightweight camp furniture like sleeping   pads, and tents with aluminum poles. You'll be much more comfortable,   and you won’t need to cut poles or boughs. Even nail holes   in trees can introduce disease.</li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Be Considerate   of Others</strong>\n    <br>\n    Be cautious   when you encounter other visitors. They may be unfamiliar   with horses and the appropriate behaviour around them - and   your stock might become nervous.<br>\n    <br>Dogs must   be under strict control at all times, and on a leash where   it’s posted. If your dog tends to harass wildlife or livestock,   leave it at home!<br>\n    <br>An abundance   of wildlife live in our Provincial Parks. Use binoculars and   telephoto lenses to get a good view. If you are close enough   that the animals show signs of distress, you are too close.<br>\n    <br>Enjoy   the sense of serenity and wilderness. Do keep noise levels   to a minimum.</li>\n</ul>\n<a href=\"./\" class=\"legacy-link\">Return to Redfern-Keily Provincial Park</a>",

Formal land use planning began in 1989. In   1991, the Kispiox Resource Management Plan recommended the Seven   Sisters as a study area. In 1994, a Kispiox planning group considered   land uses in the Seven Sisters. These recommendations were presented   by a special planning group and the Seven Sisters Provincial Park   was announced by the Provincial Government in 2000.<br>\n  <br>The area around   the Seven Sisters mountain range has stimulated interest in mineral   exploration since the late 1920s. Discoveries included veins with   gold, silver, lead and zinc, all in the headwaters of Oliver Creek.   Several log cabins were built to facilitate exploration at the time.   After a hiatus, exploration continued between 1968 and 1983, including   aeromagnetic, gravity, magnetic and geochemical surveys and trenching   to expose bedrock in areas of interest. No mineral occurrences were   considered to be economically viable for mining. The only remnant   of the area’s mining exploration history are the roads (Oliver Creek   Trail and Coyote Creek Trail) and a few dilapidated buildings outside   the Protected Area at the abandoned Magnetron Site on the Coyote   Creek Trail.\n</p>\n<a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>Cultural   Heritage</h2>\n<p>\n  Seven Sisters   Provincial Park lies within the traditional territory claimed by   the Gitxsan and Tsimshian First Nations. Traditional activities   noted by the Gitxsan include goat hunting (for meat and fur), trapping,   cedar bark stripping, berry picking and harvesting of a variety   of plants for medicinal and cultural purposes. In the region, prescribed   fire was used traditionally to improve berry patch production. The   Tsimshian people use the southern portion of the Protected Area   for hunting, trapping and fishing.\n</p>\n<a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>Conservation</h2>\n<p>\n  The   Seven Sisters is aptly named for a row of rugged peaks, four of which   reach above 2,500 m in elevation. The Protected Area contains a complete   elevational sequence of forested ecosystems from valley bottom to   alpine, including ICH, CWH, MH and AT Biogeoclimatic Zones. The forest   ecosystems possess a unique blend of coastal, interior and northern   features and are habitat for many red- and blue-listed species of   wildlife.</p>\n<a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>Wildlife</h2>\n<p>\n  Resident mountain   goat herds live within the protected area. They use the Seven Sisters   peaks and ridges during the summer, and winter in the forests near   Oliver Creek and Hells Bells Creek. Although not currently threatened,   the mountain goats are sensitive to changes in habitat, noise levels   and hunting pressures, so they will be monitored closely.\n  <br>\n  <br>Grizzly (blue-listed)   and black bears, raptors and other birds use the entire Protected   Area. In the low elevation forested area, marten and fisher (blue-listed)   use the older forests, while moose, mule deer, coyotes and wolves   tend to use the area around natural openings, burned areas and old   cutblocks. The low elevation forest between Hells Bells Creek and   Oliver Creek provides mule deer winter range. High elevation wetlands   in the Upper Price Creek drainage are likely important for migratory   waterfowl in spring and fall.\n  <br>\n  <br>Tailed frogs   (blue-listed) have been found across the Skeena River from Oliver   Creek, and may live in small tributaries within the Protected Area.   High breeding populations of rough-skinned newts live in small ponds   near Coyote Creek at the northern extent of their range. Salmon   pass through the lower reaches of all creeks; trout live within   most lakes and creeks.\n</p>",

      "content": "<a name=\"History\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"History\" href=\"/\"></a>History</h2>\n\n<p>\n  The area was first proposed for protection in 1937 and was designated a protected area in April 2001. The present boundaries were revised and designated a class A provincial park in late June of 2010. This area has long been recognized as having provincially outstanding conservation and recreation resources and has been the focus on intense public interest for wilderness preservation since the 1970’s. Through various wilderness studies and special management processes, the wilderness of the area has been largely maintained. First Nations have use the area for generations. This area has been used for over 100 years for hunting and recreating. For several decades the Gang Ranch used the area as part of their summer range.\n</p>\n<h3>\n  Ranching History\n</h3>\n<p>\n  Livestock grazing has occurred in areas now included in the park for over 70 years. From 1939 to 1964, 4300 domestic sheep were herded every May from the grasslands of Lac du Bois Park northwest of Kamloops to the Little Paradise, upper Relay, upper Graveyard, Two Lakes basin and Dash Hill area. On the return to Lac du Bois in the fall, lambs were culled from the herd at Clinton and shipped down to Ashcroft to be sent to markets in the Lower Mainland. Since 1967 the Relay-Paradise-Graveyard area has been used by cattle from Gang Ranch for summer grazing, with very large numbers in early years and considerably decreased use in recent years. Graveyard Creek is known to have had cattle grazing since 1945.\n</p>\n<h3>\n  Mining History\n</h3>\n<p>\n  Prospecting in the Big Creek /South Chilcotin Mountains Parks started in the early 1900s with many trails cut and camps established with pack horses. Grant Creek in Big Creek Park and the Eldorado-Cinnebar basin area in South Chilcotin Mountains Park were two such sites. The Gun Creek trail was created and used to service mining activity in the upper Taseko valley, in particular the Taylor Windfall gold mine. Two women, one called Dolly Moore, packed gold from the mine to the processing plant at Gold Bridge. The trail up Gun Creek and over Warner Pass was maintained by the government in the late 1920’s to 30’s and was kept open all year long.\n</p>\n<p>The W. D. Trail from Spruce Lake to Tyaughton Creek is named in honour of W. A. “Big Bill” Davidson, a Bridge River valley pioneer. He built Little Gun Lake Lodge in 1933 and later a lodge on Spruce Lake, this one for VIP hunters and fishermen. He used his many horses to pack supplies in to the Taylor Windfall Mine in the Taseko valley via Warner Pass.\n</p>\n<h3>\n  Guiding History\n</h3>\n<p>\n  <img src=\"image001.jpg\" alt=\"Guiding history\" class=\"legacy-image\">Chilco Choate was a well-known Guide-Outfitter in the Big Creek Park area from 1955 until 1992 using horses and occasionally snowmobiles. His areas of use included Graveyard, Tosh, Grant and Big creeks and Lorna Lake. He cut and recut many trails during the 1950s to 1970s.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The first Guide-Outfitting territory in British Columbia was granted in the Spruce Lake area in the late 1880s and has been operated since then on various sizes of territory. From 1954 it was operated by Pat Garrard who established a series of base camps on Spruce Lake, in Eldorado valley, Tyaughton valley and at Grant Creek and many other smaller camps. Big game hunting was the main activity. The license was purchased by Chilcotin Holidays Ltd. In 1991 and the emphasis was changed to all-season wilderness adventure tourism.\n</p>\n<h3>\n  Commercial Recreation\n</h3>\n<p>Spruce Lake Wilderness Adventures was the first commercial company to establish in what is now South Chilcotin Mountains Park, offering guided backcountry ski tours in 1982. Their first cabin in the park area was built in 1985 at 2100m.\n</p>\n<p>Since then commercial recreational use of the park has steadily increased and now a number of companies offer a variety of year-round recreational experiences.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>Cultural Heritage</h2>\n\n<h3>First Nations</h3>\n<p>\n  The area that is now South Chilcotin Mountains Park is known to have been used by First Nations peoples for at least the past 300 years, and possibly for as long as thousands of years. The area falls within the territory of three Nations: Tsilhqot’in, St’at’imc, and Secwepemc.\n</p>\n<p>Deer and mountain goats were valued for their meat and hides, while wool and horns from goats were used for salmon spears. Special ceremonies were performed before hunting grizzly and black bear as bears were considered to be too human-like. They valued the meat, fat, hides and fur. Moose did not move into the area until about 1920. (Tyhurst, 1984).\n</p>\n<p>The skins of hoary marmots were used for robes and blankets and as trade goods. These were hunted in late summer or early fall after they had hibernated; the meat was smoked and the fat was particularly prized. Dash Hill, Cardtable Mountain, Eldorado Mountain, Teepee Mountain, and Graveyard Creek are known hunting sites.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Beaver and muskrat were trapped for their meat and fur and mink for their fur. Porcupine were killed occasionally as were “rabbits” (presumably snowshoe hare). This was considered “starvation food,” the meat being used in soups and the fur for blankets.\n</p>\n<p>Fishing was most important in the big rivers of the area, but trout were caught in lakes and creeks. Game birds included ruffed, spruce and blue grouse as well as willow and white-tailed ptarmigan while waterfowl included mallard and Canada goose. Birds’ eggs were also valued.\n</p>\n<p>Berry picking and bulb digging in the high country took planning and energy to accomplish and was usually done in larger groups. Spring beauty, or Indian potato, was an important staple and Cardtable and Eldorado Mountain are specifically mentioned as collecting areas. Yellow avalanche lily, wild onion, chocolate lily, balsamroot, dandelion and prickly-pear cactus are also mentioned. Kinnikinnick, soapberry, saskatoon, chokecherry and low bush blueberry were gathered for food and also for their medicinal properties. Whitebark pine seeds or “pinion seeds” were roasted and eaten, while the inner bark of lodgepole pine and white spruce was scraped and eaten.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Many plant and tree species were used for medicinal purposes. Indian hellebore was an important medicinal plant, called “poison plant.” The roots were boiled and used as a decoction to prevent hair loss and dandruff, for bathing, for arthritis, and as an emetic. Lodgepole pine sap was used for colds and balsam fir bark for asthma and tuberculosis (TB).\n</p>\n<p>First Nations travelled by horse and on foot, establishing a network of trails that now form much of the present trail system in South Chilcotin Mountains Park. Major routes were along trails from Hanceville and Taseko Lakes to Bridge River. They left upper Big Creek via Elbow Pass to Tyaughton Creek, Spruce Lake and Gun Creek, and through Warner Pass to Gun Creek. Trails also connected Taseko valley through Iron Pass to upper Big Creek. Further trails dropped down into the Yalakom valley (Tyhurst, 1984). Camping spots were defined by the presence of quality water.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>Conservation</h2>\n\n<h3>Topography</h3>\n<p>The gently sloping valleys and dome-shaped mountains that typify the Chilcotin Ranges form the core topographic features of the park. The rounded profile of the mountains is evidence of intense glaciation in an area of largely sedimentary rocks during the last ice age. Some of the higher peaks such as Mt. Warner (2834 m) have a comparatively rugged relief resulting from recent alpine glaciation. Mt. Sheba (2550+ m) and Castle Peak (2491 m) are outstanding examples of remnant basalt-capped sedimentary formations of the Southern Chilcotin Ranges.\n</p>\n<p>Retreat of valley glaciers and subsequent stream erosion of fault-guided valleys have created the major drainages and tributaries of the area. Extensive alpine areas supply abundant water to all the creeks in the park. In the southwest, fast-flowing Slim, Leckie and upper Gun Creeks rise from the wet coastal mountains, while in the north east Tyaughton and Relay Creeks and their tributaries flow more gently through the broader valleys of the drier Chilcotin Ranges.\n</p>\n<p>Sub-alpine and alpine lakes and tarns, including South Slim, Leckie, Warner, Trigger and Hummingbird Lakes, occur at the headwaters of Slim, Leckie and Upper Gun Creeks. Spruce Lake sits in the high pass between the Gun and Tyaughton valleys, draining northwards in a steep, narrow valley to Tyaughton Creek. Warner Lake is a milky glacial blue, while Trigger is less milky and Hummingbird less yet. Spruce and Leckie are very clear. Wetlands and braided channels are typical of the upper reaches on all the southern creeks as well as upper Tyaughton Creek. Steep, fast-flowing creeks flow in all directions from the high alpine areas of the Eldorado-Taylor basin area in the south east portion of the park.\n</p>\n<h3>\n  Geology\n</h3>\n<p>\n  <img src=\"image003.jpg\" alt=\"Geology\" class=\"legacy-image\">\n  South Chilcotin Mountains Park is situated in an area of complex geology that straddles the boundary between the southeast Coast Mountains and the Chilcotin Plateau. The geological history is one of ancient ocean deposits, tectonic plate movement, faulting and mixing of rocks and layers of rocks, deposition of sedimentary rocks in shallow-marine basins, upwellings of granitic rocks and lava flows. Landscape features in South Chilcotin Mountains Park reflect the many complex geological formations that underlie it.\n</p>\n<p>Sedimentary rocks are found in the heart of South Chilcotin Mountains Park through Upper Gun and Tyaughton Creeks and Relay and middle Tyaughton Creeks. They also form the height of land from Lorna Lake to Vic Lake in Big Creek Park.\n</p>\n<p>The serrated mountains in the Slim, Leckie and upper Gun creeks are underlain by granitic rocks that are a characteristic feature of the Coast Mountains. These granitic rocks are components of the continental margin magmatic arc related to subduction of oceanic rocks along the plate boundary to the west. This is a similar process to that still going on today and generating volcanic rocks such as Mt. Baker and Mt. St. Helens.\n</p>\n<p>Volcanic rocks of Early to Middle Eocene (58 – 50 million years ago) age formed in several small volcanic centres scattered through the park. The most spectacular exposure is found at Mount Sheba, on the north side of Gun Creek.\n</p>\n<p>The youngest rocks are part of the great lava flows of 16 to 1 million years ago that formed the extensive Chilcotin Plateau. Outlying remnants of these lava flows occur in the area of Teepee, Relay and Cardtable Mountains. On Relay Mountain the basalts are up to 350 metres thick.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <img src=\"image005.jpg\" alt=\"Fossils\" class=\"legacy-image\">\n  Fossils are an important feature of South Chilcotin Mountains Park and demonstrate the marine origin of many of the sedimentary rocks. Well-preserved late triassic marine fossils (ammonites and bivalves) are found in the Tyaughton Creek area. Lower and middle jurassic rocks in this same general area are also locally rich in fossils (mainly ammonites). The Relay Mountain Group is in part extremely rich in upper jurassic and lower cretaceous fossils. Fossil-rich parts of the Relay Mountain Group are found around upper Relay Creek, Elbow Mountain and on the low bluffs northwest of Spruce Lake.\n</p>\n<h3>\n  Climate\n</h3>\n<p>\n  South Chilcotin Mountains Park comes under the influence of air masses from three directions: wet coastal air from the west; cold plateau air from the north; and, dry interior air from the east. Situated on the lee side of the main Coast Mountain Ranges, the area receives less precipitation either as rain or snow than the mountain areas to the west.\n</p>\n<p>Summer temperatures are moderately cool, although warm air from the interior helps to raise temperatures somewhat and produces less precipitation. The growing season is short throughout, but particularly so in the sub-alpine and alpine areas. Frost can be expected in most months at the lower elevation, and especially at either end of the growing season, in late spring and late summer. In the alpine, frost is expected daily. The lowest elevations of the park in lower Gun and lower Tyaughton Creek valleys are the warmest and driest parts of the park. Wind is often present throughout the year as it is funnelled through the deep valleys.\n</p>\n<p>South Chilcotin Mountains Park is influenced by warmer pacific air in winter that moderates temperatures somewhat.\n</p>\n<h3>\n  Vegetation\n</h3>\n<p>\n  Forests and plant communities in South Chilcotin Mountains Park generally reflect the leeward-rainshadow climate of the Chilcotin Plateau and Ranges. The position in the transition between northern and southern influences is indicated in the number of plant species that have been found to be at the southern limits of their range and yet others at the northern limits of their range. Temperature extremes and moderate to low precipitation rates combined with the very varied geology of the area create unique and diverse vegetation associations. The most notable are the lush grasslands and meadows in alpine and subalpine and large areas of aspen and mixed aspen – conifer forests occurring in Tyaughton, Gun and Relay Creek valleys.\n</p>\n<p>Forests are characteristically fire patterned, comprising successional stages of Engelmann spruce, sub-alpine fir and Douglas- fir forests. Expanses of lodgepole pine forest are found in flatter ground in Gun and Tyaughton Creeks. Extensive stands of white bark pine forests fringe the timberline in many valleys of South Chilcotin Mountains Park. Sub-alpine meadowland and alpine tundra form the dominant habitats of the upper valley basins and mountain ridges.\n</p>\n<p>South Chilcotin Mountains Park covers several\n  <strong>biogeoclimatic zones</strong>. The\n  <strong>Alpine Tundra zone</strong>\n  occurs throughout the many ranges of South Chilcotin Mountains Park, above 2000 m elevation, where it represents over 60% of the land base.\n</p>\n<p>Permanent snow, including glaciers, occurs on Warner Ridge and the south western ranges of South Chilcotin Mountains Park. Large areas of bare rock, steep scree slopes and avalanche chutes are found throughout the alpine. The cool, short growing season at these elevations means that any vegetation is of dwarf form and has a very brief flowering period.\n</p>\n<p>The transition position of South Chilcotin Mountains Park combined with small changes in topography and aspect creates an especially wide variety in the vegetation cover in the alpine. Low shrubs, a profusion of herbs, many mosses and colourful lichens are found in a wide variety of extensive meadow areas. Scrub, willow and bog birch dominate meadows on drier sites, while pink and white mountain-heathers occur in drier sites. Sedge meadows fill wetter sites and stunted trees or krummholz occur at lower elevations.\n</p>\n<p>Large un-vegetated areas are found in the southwest portion of the park in the higher elevations of upper Slim, Leckie and Gun Creek valleys. Alpine meadows are most extensive in the Upper Relay, Little Paradise and Eldorado valleys creating spectacular floral displays in the short summer season. Meadows in other alpine areas are no less spectacular, but less extensive.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <img src=\"image007.jpg\" alt=\"Flower meadows\" class=\"legacy-image\">\n  The\n  <strong>Engelmann Spruce-sub-alpine fir zone</strong>\n  (ESSF) occurs below the Alpine Tundra in South Chilcotin Mountains Park. This zone typically has a continuous forest cover of conifers, including various combinations of Engelmann spruce, sub-alpine fir and, on drier sites, whitebark pine and lodgepole pine. At the highest elevations the forest thins out to parkland with clumps of trees in widespread meadows that interweave with similar alpine communities. There are extensive areas of wind-blown clumps of bushy conifers called krummholz throughout the zone.\n</p>\n<p>White-flowered rhododendron is the most common shrub in the zone, and black huckleberry, grouseberry and false azalea frequently occur. Subalpine meadows include heath-dominated meadows, flower meadows and grasslands. Snow often lingers in heath-dominated meadows providing abundant moisture for a variety of mountain-heathers. Flower meadows often contain swaths of Indian hellebore, arrow-leaved groundsel, paintbrush, Sitka valerian and other flowering herbs.\n</p>\n<p>The\n  <strong>Montane Spruce zone</strong>\n  is represented by a dry cold variant in South Chilcotin Mountains Park. This drier variant occurs below ESSF on the south-facing slopes of middle Tyaughton Creek and the lower slopes of lower Gun Creek, Leckie and Slim Creeks. It is also found as a thin band below the ESSF on the south-facing slopes of the Pearson Creek ridge.\n</p>\n<p>Forests are open with mixtures of lodgepole pine, varying amounts of Engelmann spruce and sub-alpine fir and little understory vegetation. On north-facing slopes Engelmann spruce and sub-alpine fir form dense stands, while Douglas-fir and lodgepole pine are found on drier sites with bluebunch wheatgrass, common juniper, kinnikinnick and balsamroot. Unusual combinations of conifers are found on the dry south-facing slopes of Tyaughton Creek including varying mixtures of Douglas-fir, lodgepole pine, sub-alpine fir, spruce and whitebark pine. Scattered ponderosa pine are also found, where they are at the western and near the northern extent of their range. Extensive grasslands occur on the steep south-facing slopes of Tyaughton Creek; through the middle Gun Creek valley they extend down from those identified in the adjacent ESSF subzone.\n</p>\n<p>The\n  <strong>Interior Douglas-fir zone</strong>\n  is the driest of the ecosystems in the park and is found in the lowest portions of Gun Creek valley. It is a system that is not well represented in protected areas. Forests are open and dominated by lodgepole pine with Douglas-fir regeneration. Birch-leaved spirea and falsebox are found in an understory dominated by pinegrass. Pure Douglas-fir stands with an understory of saskatoon, birch-leaved spirea and bluebunch wheatgrass occur on dry south-facing slopes.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>Wildlife</h2>\n\n<p>\n  South Chilcotin Mountains Park provides rich and diverse habitats for a variety of wildlife associated with high-elevation mountain and plateau habitats. Lush alpine and sub-alpine meadows, broad upland valleys and extensive shrubby wetlands are only a few of the habitats available. Cold, long winters restrict the variety of species, but the quality of habitats attracts large numbers of some species, especially during the short summer and fall seasons. This provides visitors with some outstanding wildlife viewing opportunities.\n</p>\n<h3>\n  <strong>Mammals</strong>\n</h3>\n<p>\n  Many species of large mammals are found in the mountains of South Chilcotin Mountains Park. Some essential habitat elements make this area particularly important, including: lush alpine meadows, salty mineral springs, rocky escape terrain, wind-swept and snow-free areas and isolation from human activity or development. Mountain goats share habitat with mule deer and grizzly bear are found with California bighorn sheep and moose. In the Eldorado-Taylor-Cinnabar Basin area grizzly bear share habitats with mule deer and mountain goats. The variety of habitats supports a very wide diversity of mammals.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Mountain goats</strong>\n  require undisturbed areas for birthing and rearing, for foraging near escape terrain and for thermal and security cover. In winter they move short distances to forested areas on south and western-facing open slopes or wind-blown ridges. The Eldorado Mountain area is rated as exceptional habitat for goats. Mountain goat winter range and associated significant range is also found on the west-facing slopes of Gun Creek from lower Windy Pass to lower Eldorado Creek. On the ridge from Mount Sheba to the Warner Pass area goats and California bighorn sheep winter together in their preferred habitats. The upper elevations of the southern mountain ridges provide important winter range through upper Gun Creek, Leckie Creek and upper Slim Creek valleys.\n</p>\n<p>The moist forests, shrubby forests, swamps and wetlands of South Chilcotin Mountains Park support numbers of\n  <strong>moose</strong>\n  in the summer, where they browse on deciduous twigs and foliage. The valley bottoms and wet meadows of Gun Creek and Tyaughton Creek are the best locations in the park to see these large mammals.\n</p>\n<p>The park is an important area for\n  <strong>mule deer</strong>\n  in the summer and fall. The open forests, clearings and wetlands provide abundant shelter and forage. Mule deer are very visible in the summer months, especially around Spruce Lake and Gun Creek grasslands and in the subalpine. Isolated pockets of deer winter range are found in the park and the Douglas-fir forests on lower Gun Creek and south of the park are also mule deer winter range. Important migration corridors through eastern portions of the park bring deer from lower elevation winter and spring ranges through Lone Valley Creek to Tyaughton Creek and through Dash Creek to upper Relay Creek. Deer collared on the Fraser River have been found later in the year at the headwaters of Tyaughton and Relay creeks.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>California bighorn sheep</strong>\n  are common but not abundant throughout an extensive area that covers the western and northern portions of the park. In general bighorn sheep are resident in the area, a situation unique to these herds. Bighorn sheep populations in the park are stable and healthy. Sheep are found west to Mt. Sheba, over the ridges of the upper Tyaughton valley into Little Paradise and along the Tyaughton ridge towards Castle Peak. Waterholes in escape terrain are important for sheep use of the dry tundra areas. Lambing is known to occur in the Lizard Creek area. Most sheep summering in the park migrate to winter habitats in the southern end of Big Creek Park (e.g. Tosh Creek, Elbow Mountain and the Lorna Lake Ridge) where sun keeps the snowpack on the slopes somewhat reduced.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Grizzly bears</strong>\n  require large, relatively undisturbed areas containing critical habitat elements for feeding, bedding and denning. Forage requirements include glacier lilies, whitebark pine, skunk cabbage and berries. Late spring is spent on avalanche slopes, moving higher as summer progresses to wetter forest riparian sites, meadows and wetlands where there is abundant vegetation. There are few options for fishing in the park. Grizzlies are known to forage for marmots and pika by tearing holes in their burrows. Whitebark pine seeds are an especially important part of a grizzly bear’s food in the park.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <img src=\"image009.jpg\" alt=\"Grizzly bears\" class=\"legacy-image\">\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Black bear</strong>\n  are found throughout South Chilcotin Mountains Park feeding in meadows, riparian areas avalanche chutes and grassy south-facing slopes.\n  <strong>Cougar</strong>\n  are present but numbers are unknown. Bear and cougar use the upper portions of the park as escape terrain away from contact with cattle.\n  <strong>Wolves</strong>\n  are known to inhabit the eastern portions of the park.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Hoary marmot, pika\n  </strong>and<strong>\n    Columbia ground</strong>\n  squirrels are just some of the smaller mammals found in the sub-alpine and alpine meadows and edges. All are active for only very short periods in the warmest summer months. They make up an important part of the diet of\n  <strong>golden eagles</strong>.\n</p>\n<p>A wide variety of small furbearers occur in South Chilcotin Mountains Park including\n  <strong>lynx, beaver, mink</strong>\n  and\n  <strong>muskrat</strong>.\n  <strong>Marten</strong>\n  are found in low numbers using large blocks of undisturbed, slightly wetter Engelmann spruce/subalpine fir forests.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Wolverine</strong>, which have been seen in South Chilcotin Mountains Park, prefer undisturbed, remote wilderness. Extensive seasonal movements in search of food mean that they can be found in a variety of places depending on the season. Young are born and raised near natal dens in large boulder talus slopes; in summer alpine tundra and krummholz slopes are preferred where they prey on hoary marmots. They move down to forested areas in winter in a large home range.\n</p>\n<h3>\n  Birds\n</h3>\n<p>The high elevations habitats with short growing season found in South Chilcotin Mountains Park do not support a large variety of bird species. However, the extent of some of the special habitats mean that there are high numbers of certain species. Species that are able to forage for food through the harsh winter conditions are resident year-round, such as seed-eaters, predators, scavengers and those that glean insects from bark. The short season of open water and low productivity in most of the larger lakes mean that waterfowl species are limited, although the haunting call of the\n  <strong>common loon</strong>\n  is regularly heard on Spruce Lake.\n</p>\n<p>Alpine areas provide habitat for\n  <strong>horned lark</strong>\n  and\n  <strong>American pipit</strong>\n  that arrive as snow is melting and leave before the first snows arrive.\n  <strong>Rock, white-tailed and willow ptarmigan</strong>\n  are permanent residents; South Chilcotin Mountains Park is the southern limit for willow ptarmigan.\n  <strong>Franklin’s, blue and ruffed grouse\n  </strong>are residents of the high-elevation spruce-fir forests along with\n  <strong>red crossbills, white-winged crossbills, gray jay, Steller’s jay\n  </strong>and<strong>\n    pine grosbeaks</strong>. Whitebark pine areas provide abundant food for a variety of birds, the most notable being the\n  <strong>Clark’s nutcracker</strong>. The seeds of whitebark pine are wingless, so cannot be carried any distance by the wind. Nutcrackers feast on the seeds, gathering as many as a hundred seeds in pouches in their throats; the seeds are disgorged in batches into underground caches. Abandoned or forgotten caches provide the seeds needed for new generations of trees.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <img src=\"image011.jpg\" alt=\"Bird\" class=\"legacy-image\">\n  A variety of birds of prey are reported to include\n  <strong>bald eagle, gyrfalcon, rough-legged hawk, Swainson’s hawk, northern harrier</strong>and<strong>\n    red-tailed hawk</strong>. Cliffs provide nesting sites for\n  <strong>golden eagles</strong>\n  that feed on large rodents such as hoary marmots and Columbian ground squirrels.\n  <strong>Prairie falcon</strong>\n  adult and juveniles have been seen near Spruce Lake.\n  <strong>Great gray owl</strong>\n  and\n  <strong>great horned owl</strong>\n  are year-round residents, as are\n  <strong>three-toed, black-backed, pileated and hairy woodpeckers</strong>.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Chickadees, nuthatches, pine siskin, golden-crowned and ruby-crowned kinglet</strong>\n  are common throughout the forested areas.\n  <strong>American dippers</strong>\n  are present in many of the creeks.\n  <strong>Hermit and Swainsons thrushes, American robin, magnolia warbler</strong>and<strong>\n    yellow-rumped warblers</strong>\n  are only a few of the summer visitors known to nest.\n</p>\n<h3>\n  Reptiles and Amphibians</h3>\n<p>Few reptiles and amphibians are able to survive the harsh winter conditions found in South Chilcotin Mountains Park. Common garter snake and Western terrestrial garter snake have been reported.\n</p>\n<h3>\n  Fish\n</h3>\n<p>\n  <strong>Rainbow trout\n  </strong>and<strong>\n    bull trout</strong>\n  are recorded from most of the larger creeks, with bull trout seeming to stay higher up in creek systems to avoid competition with rainbow trout. Bull trout are known to be resident in the full length of Gun Creek. Bull trout require clean, cold, well-oxygenated water in stream areas with a steep gradient. Ground water seepage channels are also sometimes used for spawning and large, deep pools are needed for overwintering. Spawning, foraging and wintering habitats may be some distance apart so it is important that the connections between all habitat requirements are protected.\n</p>\n<p>Rainbow trout are present in Spruce, Trigger, Hummingbird and Warner Lakes.\n  <strong>Mountain whitefish</strong>\n  are recorded in Spruce Lake and Gun Creek, while\n  <strong>kokanee</strong>\n  originate out of Carpenter Lake.\n</p>\n<h3>\n  Insects\n</h3>\n<p>Little is known about the insect populations in any provincial parks, although most visitors are aware that they are there. Many insects fly up to mountain tops in large numbers to mate, the females staying for brief visits only before returning to their favoured habitat below.\n  <strong>Bristly tachinid flies, flower flies, sarcophagid flies, blow flies\n  </strong>and\n  <strong>swallowtail butterflies</strong>\n  are but a few.\n  <strong>Ladybird beetles</strong>\n  congregate in alpine areas before hibernating together under boulders in large groups. Grizzly bears are known to feed on beetles and moths in the sub-alpine. Although no inventories of\n  <strong>Deer and Horse flies</strong>\n  have been done in the park, these flies have been known to sample humans here.\n</p>\n<p>Many insects are considered pests in the forests of the park.\n  <strong>Mountain pine beetles</strong>\n  attack lodgepole pine trees in some numbers every year, but have built up to very large numbers in mature lodgepole forests of the park in the last few years. British Columbia is currently experiencing a landscape level pine beetle event. Infested trees are magnets for a variety of woodpeckers, some of which strip large sections of bark off infested trees to reach the larvae.\n</p>\n<p></p>",

A management plan for this area was then developed between   local residents and representatives of the BC Forest Service. In   1996, the 19,273 hectare Wilderness Area was then designated as Class A Park providing   full protection under the\n  <em>Park Act</em>\n  for the 19,273 hectares. In 1999,   the Provincial Government accepted the recommendations of the Upper   Kispiox Planning Group by designating an additional 43,046 hectares   as Class A Park. BC Parks now manages the entire 62,319 hectares   as Swan Lake Kispiox River Provincial Park.\n</p>\n<a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>Cultural Heritage</h2>\n<p>\n  Swan Lake/Kispiox River Provincial Park lies within the traditional  territories of the Gitanyow and Gitxsan First Nations, who have used the area for thousands of years.  Their hunting, fishing and gathering activities have created many of the trails that are there today. This park  and the surrounding area are important to First Nations peoples  for sustenance and cultural activities. Although no formal sites  are identified within the Swan Lake/Kispiox River Park, First Nations  still actively use the park for many traditional uses.\n</p>\n<a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>Conservation</h2>\n<p>\n  The park contains   a unique chain of undeveloped lakes, rivers, and swamps that contributes   to the flow and water quality of the salmon-rich Kispiox River.   The closed canopy old-growth interior cedar and hemlock forest provides   habitat for strong populations of grizzly bear and moose.<br>\n  <br>The Swan Lake   Kispiox River area is virtually undisturbed and is an unmodified   natural environment with very few trails. Because of the natural   integrity of this park, there is little evidence of human impact   or non-native vegetation.

As well, the lakes   support a healthy population of resident rainbow trout, cutthroat   trout, Dolly Varden char and whitefish.<br>\n  <br>The abundant   population of salmon helps attract and support a significant population   of grizzly bears. This area is also excellent for black bears, mountain   goats, wolves, moose, beaver, river otter and mink.<br>\n  <br>Many forest  bird species are present. Sightings of bald eagles and osprey  are common. Gulls, terns and loons are abundant as well as waterfowl  such as swans, buffleheads, goldeneyes, and common mergansers.

The   estate was purchased in December 1995 and officially became a park   in the Spring of 1996. It is one of the few remaining natural areas   in the Okanagan that has not yet succumbed to the pressures of growth   and development.<br>\n  <br>The Protected Area was established on April 18, 2001\n</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>Cultural Heritage</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n  The small amount of archaeological evidence visible at Fintry suggests  that the Shorts Creek delta was a summer fishing camp and was  on a trade route through the Okanagan Region. During the 19th  century, fur traders for the Hudson’s Bay Company were the first  to make contact with the native inhabitants of the valley. The  park contains a short section of the Okanagan Brigade Trail.<br>\n  <br>The Fintry Estate exemplifies the agricultural and settlement history  of the Okanagan Valley. It was one of the valley’s early  pioneer settlements functioning as a self-sufficient community  in the early 1900’s. Fintry’s first Eurocanadian  settler was a pioneer steamboat captain, Thomas D. Shorts who  established a fleet of freight boats on Okanagan Lake and played  an important role in the maritime history of the Okanagan.<br>\n  <br>In 1909, James Cameron Dunwaters purchased the property naming it  Fintry after an ancestral estate in Scotland. He erected many  of the heritage buildings which currently exist, including the  Manor House, made of stone quarried from the area, the very unique  Octagonal Dairy Barn for his Ayrshire cattle, the Packing House,  the Gatekeepers House and several farm buildings. Remnants of  power generation and irrigation systems are visible along Shorts  Creek. The octagonal barn and packing house are possible candidates  for national historic designation underscoring their value and  the importance of the park.\n</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>Conservation</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n  The high importance of the park for conservation  is unexpected in an area this size given its immense heritage value.  A key feature protected by the park is the Shorts Creek Canyon,  which contains many scenic waterfalls. It offers important spawning  grounds for kokanee and essential rearing habitat for rainbow trout  and eastern brook trout in their first two years of life.\n  <br>\n  <br>Fintry was important within the historic range of California bighorn  sheep with a full range of habitat including escape terrain along  the canyon. The park also has class one deer winter range that  is used extensively during severe winter conditions.\n  <br>\n  <br>The old growth cottonwoods along the beach are a red listed plant  community. The park offers two dramatically different topographical  areas: a delta at the mouth of Shorts Creek dominated by old orchard  trees and hay fields, and a forested area made up of mature ponderosa  pine and Douglas-fir. Ponderosa pine forest is one of the most  threatened forest types because of urban growth and resource development  activities and is very sensitive to disturbance. Another rare plant  found in the park is the blue listed Okanagan Flame Flower.\n</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>Wildlife</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n  Blue listed California bighorn sheep and Townsend’s Big-eared  bats are present in the park along with the red listed Western  Grebe. Other wildlife is abundant and includes black and grizzly  bear, lynx, marten, coyote, moose, white-tail and mule deer, ruffed  grouse, northern goshawk, great horned owl, pileated woodpecker.  A bald eagle’s nest is found in the cottonwoods south of  the Packing House.\n</blockquote>\n<p></p>",

A cabin built in 1909 for Earl Grey and his family remains in deteriorating condition above the Toby Creek trail about twenty minutes walk from the Toby Creek trailhead. The trail Grey followed by horseback and foot was well known by First Nations people and the West Kootenay mining boom of the 1890’s and early 1900’s made the trail into an important access and supply route from the east, with even cattle being driven over it from Invermere on occasion.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The Purcell Mountains wilderness so impressed Grey that he wrote to the then Premier of British Columbia, Richard McBride, urging that this magnificent scenic mountain area be set aside as a national park. Nothing came of Grey’s proposal, however, and for over half a century the trail and the mountains remained the preserve of a few trappers, outfitters, foresters, and prospectors.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In 1904 the Argenta mining company operated a compressor station about 8 kilometres up from Lardeau on the lower end of Hamill Creek that supplied air to the Argenta Mine on Lavina Ridge above it. A four-horse wagon road was constructed up the Hamill Creek canyon with portions of the road hung from the canyon wall. A massive pelton wheel was hauled into place to drive the compressor. It is still in its original location along the trail. The mine closed in 1905 after operating only one year.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In the mid 1960’s Rod and Gun Club members from Invermere began lobbying for a Conservancy in the Purcell’s. With industrial logging development coming to many valleys in the area local people felt a sense of urgency to protect this spectacular area. In 1970, the historical and recreational values of the Earl Grey Pass Trail were recognized by the community of Argenta which made reopening the trail its project for the 1971 British Columbia Centennial. In 1971-72 Federal Opportunities for Youth (OFY) funds supported the efforts of area people to re-establish the trail. Though deviating from the original route owing to the forest-fire impacts, creek crossing problems and money and manpower constraints, the OFY project strengthened a reawakening interest in the area Earl Grey had recommended for national park status.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In 1974, as a result of lobbying by conservationists, outdoor clubs and individuals through an Order-in-Council that literally stopped the bulldozers the Purcell Wilderness Conservancy encompassing 131,500 hectares of the Purcell Mountains was created. The Conservancy, together with the adjacent 9,164-hectare St. Mary’s Alpine Provincial park and 550-hectare Fry Creek Canyon Recreation Area, were preserved for their ecological and recreational values. In the 1980’s, amendments provided for application of the Park Act and Regulations and in 1995 an expanded Purcell Wilderness Conservancy became a British Columbia Class A Provincial Park.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>Cultural Heritage</h2>\n<p></p>\n<a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>Conservation</h2>\n<p>\n  The Purcell   Wilderness Conservancy Park is one of the first large scale   wilderness areas in Canada to be set aside as a result of local   citizen action. This contiguous undisturbed wilderness is critical   in maintaining the viability and biodiversity of the largest   intact ecosystem in southeastern BC – the Purcell Mountains.<br>\n  <br>The Purcell   Mountains embrace high glaciated mountains, resplendent alpine   lakes, verdant wetlands, magnificent old growth forests and   rushing rivers. These features provide habitat for an abundant   variety of plant and animal communities. All of the ungulates   of the Kootenay region, except bighorn sheep, are found within   the Conservancy as well as many species of carnivore and smaller   animals.<br>\n  <br>The Purcell   Conservancy Park preserves a way of life as well as natural   values. Guide-outfitters and residents have accessed the east   side of the conservancy with pack trains for many years to hunt   a sustainable wildlife population and for sightseeing expeditions.   On the west side cultural artifacts from the early mining period   are still in place along the lower Hamill Creek and Fry Creek   canyon is often visited by local hikers.\n</p>\n<a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>Wildlife</h2>\n<p></p>",

This trail ends at private property and there is no designated trail access to the community of Birchdale at this time.</strong>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Dewar Hot Springs<a name=\"spring\" href=\"/\"></a>\n</h3>\n<p>One of the special features of the  park is the Dewar Creek hot springs. Water flowing through  fractures  into the substrate is heated to temperatures above 100 C or  boiling point. It rises to the surface carrying many minerals  in solution especially calcium, magnesium and sulphur compounds.  Hot water at the surface vents is above 80 C, too hot for bathing.  Visitors to the springs have created a variety of pools over  the years using both natural and manmade materials. All except  one small pool have been removed. BC Parks will continue to  remove any new construction and request your cooperation. The  intrinsic value of the springs for wildlife use far outweighs  modification of the springs for recreational bathing. Far better,  more accessible opportunities for hot spring soaking exist  at  other locations in the Kootenay’s.<br>\n  <br>The minerals   brought to the surface by the hot mineral springs form critical   licks for five species of ungulates: elk, goat, white tail deer,   mule deer, and moose providing them with high concentrations   of minerals and nutrients during May through July, the birthing   seasons. Unfortunately increased human visitation to the springs   has displaced many of these animals and as a result wildlife   populations in the upper Dewar have decreased.<br>\n  <br>\n  A number   of rare vascular plants grow in the side hill bog immediately   above the springs: Western St. John’s-wort, a yellowish   orange flowered herb, Slender muhlenbergia, a small grass that   occurs in dense mats close to the hot springs vents and Hot–springs   Panicum another grass unique to hot springs ecosystems.\n  <br>\n  <br>A red-listed   damselfly Argia vivida commonly known as the “Vivid Dancer”  has been identified at Dewar hot springs. Blue in colour it   is sometimes seen clinging to the rubble and boulders near the   hot-springs.<br>\n  <br>\n  The Engelmann   spruce-subalpine fir (ESSF) zone around the springs is dominated   by Engelmann Spruce and sub-alpine fir. False azlea, white-flowed   rhododendron and huckleberry are common.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  Dewar hot springs and adjacent Bugle Basin area are an intricate   and interdependent ecosystem. Just as ungulates depend on the   hot spring licks for nutrients predators such as grizzly bear,   wolves and wolverine depend on productive ungulate populations.\n  <br>\n  <br>This fragile   and diverse area can be visited using an old outfitting trail.   Drive west on the St. Mary’s forest service road 47 kilometres   to the junction of the West Fork St. Mary’s road and the   Dewar Creek road. Bear right and follow the Dewar Creek road   to the end at the 27 km (the last 4 km is a very rough road and high clearance vehicles are recommended). There is a trail registry located at   the beginning of the trail. After crossing Wesley Creek continue   for about 1.5 hours till you drop down by the creek. If on horse   the trail will soon cross the creek. If on foot scramble up   onto the east bank and continue along a rough hiking trail that   will rejoin the old outfitting trail, continue to the springs.   About 3-4 hours total time.\n  <br>\n  <br>At the springs   the trail contours above the springs area and continues another   .5 km to Bugle Basin, a huge slide area, where hiker camping   is allowed. There is an established horse camping area across   the creek to the west, follow the trail that crosses the Dewar   Creek immediately after emerging from the forest. Follow up   the left side of Bugle Basin about .5 km then follow the trail   back into the hidden meadow where an established horse camp   is located. Please do not horse camp on the east side of Bugle   Basin.<br>\n  <br>Past visitors   have trampled the side hill area above the springs and destroyed   rare habitat. In an effort to allow these areas to regenerate   do not camp above the springs or trample the bog area. To traverse   the hot springs use the horse trail above the bogs or the rocks   along the creek.<br>\n</p>\n<h3>The Earl Grey Pass Trail<a name=\"earlGrey\" href=\"/\"></a>\n</h3>\nThe Earl Grey Pass Trail extends approximately 63 kilometres  from Argenta at the north end of Kootenay Lake in the West  Kootenay,   up Hamill Creek, over the Purcell crest, and down Toby Creek  toward Invermere in the East Kootenay. Conditions vary on  this   rigorous wilderness trail, and it should not be attempted except  by experienced and well-equipped hikers. Extreme care must  be   taken whenever a creek is crossed, whether by bridge, by cable-car,  or by fording. An average hiking-time for the trail is five    days, but all suggested times are approximate, depending upon  weather and individual hikers.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Argenta to Earl Grey Pass</strong>\n<br>\nLength: Approximately 45 kilometres.   (2-3 days) Elevation gain from Argenta to Earl Grey Pass 1,341   metres. Maximum elevation 2,256 metres. Suggested hiking time;   three days.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Argenta to Compressor Site\n</strong>\n<br>\nThe Hamill Creek section of the Earl Grey Pass Trail starts   near the old mining community of Argenta on the east side of   Kootenay Lake. Argenta is accessible by secondary road from   Highway 31 north of Lardeau. Follow the main road through the   community for 4.25 kilometres beyond the Argenta Post Office.   The trail begins as a rough logging track branching left from   a sharp right bend on the main road. After about 1 kilometre,   the track ends in a small clearing, from the lower right-hand   end of which the hiking trail commences a steady but steep descent   to an old bridge crossing Clint Creek. The trail then leads   to Hamill Creek valley along the bed of a 1904 wagon road which   includes some of its original bridging and corduroy sections.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>First Cable Car Crossing\n</strong>\n<br>\nThe trail crosses Hamill Creek for the first time on a cable   car installed prior to 1929 at the site of an old bridge. BC   Parks has recently replaced all cable cars. Ensure that you   bring gloves for pulling the car along the cable. It is then   a short hike to the compressor site. At the compressor site   is an example of the mining activity that took place in the   area during the early 20th century; of interest is a 10-drill   Allis-Chalmers compressor, driven by a pelton wheel which originally   had a 35-metre head of water obtained from a small wing dam   750 metres up Hamill Creek. High-pressure air was pumped 1,200   metres up to the Argenta lead-silver mine on Lavina Ridge above   Hamill Creek. In 1906, the year after the compressor was installed,   the mine closed as ore ran out and eventually the incredible   road built through the lower canyon became impassable to wagons.   Hikers may wish to view the mine workings, rudimentary trails   lead to them from the compressor site, however visitors are   cautioned to stay out of the unstable mine tunnels and shafts.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Second Cable Car Crossing: Near the Compressor Site</strong>\n<br>\nFrom the compressor site, a short walk leads to McLaughlin Cabin,   built by miners in 1906, and to a cable car, the second crossing   over Hamill Creek. For about 2.5 km beyond the second crossing,   the trail leads through an area of old forest fire burns where   it is interesting to observe the succession forest of young   alder, hemlock and Douglas-fir reclaiming the land. The valley   floor is a climax forest of western hemlock and cedar undisturbed   by any trace of roads, logging or mining. Fires have not reached   the riparian zones for centuries and some of the giant trees   are close to a thousand years old.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Third Cable Car Crossing</strong>\n<br>\nAbout 8 km after entering the mature forest the trail arrives   at the third cable car crossing where the trail crosses to the   north side of the creek.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Fourth Cable Car Crossing</strong>\n<br>\nIt is about five km to the next crossing.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Fifth Cable Car Crossing</strong>\n<br>\nThe vegetation of the valley floor now reflects the transition   from the hemlock, cedar, Devil’s Club, and ferns of the   Western Hemlock Biogeoclimatic Zone into a subzone of the more   open canopied Engelmann Spruce and Subalpine Fir Biogeoclimatic   Zone in which white rhododendron and black mountain huckleberry   compose the major ground cover.<br>\nApproximately 5 km above the fifth cable car crossing you cross   Rock Creek, a small tributary of Hamill flowing down from a   bowl below Cauldron Mountain to the north.<br>\nFrom Rock Creek it is about 3 kilometres to the bottom of the  meadows, an area of spruce bog and sedge meadow. From Moose  meadows campground, a newer section of trail aproximately 5  km long has been constucted on the North side of Hamill Creek  that elimminates two dangerous log crossings over Hamill Creek.  The trail then rejoins the old trail just before the North  forks campground. Just past the North Fork of Hamill Creek, the trail climbs steeply for about 800 metres on a good grade.\n<br>\n<br>\n<h3>Fry Creek Trail<a name=\"fry\" href=\"/\"></a>\n</h3>\n<strong>History</strong>\n<br>\nAs many other areas, the Fry Creek Trail has its early beginnings in mining. A placer claim was established on Fry Creek in 1893, but the area remained inactive until the 1920’s when a group of prospectors established the Pegleg Mine near the Confluence of Fry and Carney Creeks. They had discovered gold near the mouth of Fry Creek, and speculated that they would find the source here. To move equipment and supplies to the site, a pack horse trail was built from Johnson’s Landing to the mine site. Carving a trail out of the steep canyon required extensive drilling and blasting, and one of the workers fell to his death while constructing it. The prospectors eventually lost interest after years of effort produced only marginal returns.\n<br>\n<br>\nIn 1935, another prospector bought out the claim, and he and his family maintained the Trail for some time. But he was also unable to make it profitable, and finally gave up on the mine after yielding only 31 grams of gold. The Fry and Carney Creeks also attracted the Bacchus’s brothers who trapped throughout these drainages. The Bacchus’s were also responsible for stringing telegraph wire and introduced early communication to Birchdale, some of which can still be seen on the trail between this Community and Johnson’s Landing.<br>\n<br>The Fry Creek Canyon Recreation Area was originally established to protect the Trail and the unique geological features of the Canyon. In 1995 the boundaries of the neighbouring Purcell Wilderness Conservancy were expanded to include the Fry Creek Canyon Recreation Area, and the resulting 202,709ha were designated as a Class “A” Provincial Park. The Purcell Wilderness Conservancy, along with the adjacent St. Mary’s Alpine Park (9,164ha) protects a significant, wild and beautiful region within the Purcell Mountains.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>The Fry Creek Trail</strong>\n<br>\nAll persons should have proper footwear and children should be accompanied and closely supervised by adults at all times. Use topographic 1:50,000 scale map 82K/2.\n<strong>Note: The Birchdale Trail continues for 2km beyond the Fry Creek bridge. This trail ends at private property and there is no designated trail access to the community of Birchdale at this time.</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\n<h3>Toby Creek to Earl Grey Pass<a name=\"tobyEarlGrey\" href=\"/\"></a>\n</h3>\nLength: Approximately 16 kilometres. Elevation gain from Toby  Creek to Earl Grey Pass: 1,070 metres.\n<br>\nMaximum elevation: 2,256  metres. Suggested hiking time, (2-3 days)<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Invermere  to Toby Creek</strong>\n<strong>and Earl Grey Pass trailhead\n</strong>– Approximately  32 km (20 miles) by road.<br>\nFrom Invermere  follow the road that takes you to Panorama ski resort, at  the ski area turn off (apx. Km 15 ) continue straight and  stay on the Toby Creek FSR. You will pass Delphine Creek  FSR and further up you will cross Jumbo Creek bridge. Just  past the bridge the Road forks right to go to Jumbo pass  or left to go to the Earl Grey Pass. Stay left and you will  immediately be at the parking area for Earl Grey Pass Trail.  This is the best place to park, (it is possible to drive  further in a high clearance vehicle, but this road is unmaintained  and not recommended). At the trailhead follow the old road  along Toby creek past the old horse coral and follow the  sign pointing you to the right at the next fork, continue  on this old road/trail until you reach the Park Boundary.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>USE   EXTREME CAUTION AT ALL TIMES WHILE TRAVELLING THE TOBY CREEK   ROAD. LOGGING TRUCKS USE THE ROAD EXTENSIVELY DURING WORKING\n</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>\n  Boundary to Pharaoh Creek\n</strong>\n<br>\nShortly after the Boundary the trail crosses three open slide   meadows divided by strips of pine forest. At the second of these   meadows is the cabin built for then Governor General Earl Grey   in 1909. Pharaoh Creek is reached after crossing the third meadow.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Pharaoh Creek to MacKay’s Slide\n</strong>\n<br>\nThe trail follows along or above the creek. At MacKay Falls   the trail climbs through an old forest. You will come to a drift-fence.   Beyond the drift fence, about five minutes along, the trail   will split. The lower trail goes down to the creek and the upper   trail climbs onto a large slide path, Mckay Slide, then goes   up the slide and across it. Where the trail starts to drop near   the west side of the slide is the elevation at which you should   enter the forest. The trail will drop down about 25 vertical   metres and then climb up through brush into the forest where   a good trail will continue. Do not go down to the creek unless   you want to camp.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Toby Falls Camp\n</strong>\n<br>\nThe trail enters the forest on the west side of the McKay Slide,   the trail maintains its elevation, following the contour around   Redtop and Bannock Basin to a point above Toby Falls. Just above   Toby Falls below the trail is a camp next to the creek.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Toby Falls Camp to Earl Grey Pass</strong>\n<br>\nAbove Toby Falls the trail climbs, gradually, passing the outwash   plain of Toby Glacier on the left. The trail is reasonably graded   with a few steep switchbacks near the end. About ten minutes   before you reach the pass there are a couple of small creeks   crossing the trail. This is the last source of water until you   are over the pass and down into the forest on the Hamill Creek   side.",

These peoples historically led a nomadic lifestyle, travelling when   necessary to find food and resources. This lifestyle is called the   “seasonal round”, and is still practiced in a modified form by some   native peoples today. The Itcha Ilgachuz was used by First Nations   to hunt and trap animals such as beaver, caribou, moose, and martin,   and to gather plants, roots, and obsidian in summer. Traditional   fishing camps were also located in the area.To date, only  one archaeological site has been identified near one of the obsidian  quarries in the  Itcha Ilgachuz.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Settlement   History:</strong>\n  Early in the 1900s, settlers gradually moved into the   area via Bella Coola, and began setting up ranches in the park vicinity.   In particular, the journey of Pan Phillips and Rich Hobson is documented   in Hobson’s book Grass Beyond the Mountains. The Blackwater Trail,   which passes between the two mountain ranges in the park, was used   to carry supplies and cattle from the Home Ranch to and from Anahim   Lake to be sold at cattle sales in Quesnel. The Home Ranch is still   present today, and several supply routes are still evident in the   area.\n</p>\n<a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2></h2>\n<p></p>\n<a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>Conservation</h2>\n<p>\n  Itcha Ilgachuz  Provincial Park protects provincially significant caribou habitat  as well as the northernmost occurrence of California  bighorn sheep in North America.

The most northerly   population of California bighorn sheep, and extensive summer and   winter moose range are also found within the park. With binoculars,   park visitors may be lucky enough to spot a mountain goat or golden   eagle in the more rugged terrain.<br>\n  <br>Other furbearers   include beaver, muskrat, coyote, marten, red fox, wolverine, river   otter, bobcat, and lynx. The area’s wetland habitats also support   waterfowl, game birds, songbirds, amphibians, and reptile.\n</p>",

Skook from Tundar Lake in Stein Valley\" class=\"legacy-image\">\n<br>The Stein Valley   was heavily glaciated and is dominated by glacial landforms. All   of the main valleys except the lower canyon have the characteristic   U-shape of glacial eroded troughs, and many of the tributaries to   the Stein River exhibit “hanging” valleys. The upper reaches of   the watershed are dotted with a large number of small mountain lakes   (tarns), many of which occupy cirques. The Stein River has 2 extensive   canyon sections, one at the east end of the valley and one at the   west end. The Park has a wide range of elevations, from about 220   metres (700 feet) above sea level at the eastern end to 2954 metres   (9,750 feet) at the summit of Skihist Mtn. There are about a dozen   other peaks along the boundary that are over 2,438 metres (8,000   feet). Some of the key elevations in and around the Park are:\n<ul>\n  <li>Main (eastern) trail head 220 metres\n  </li>\n  <li>Cottonwood Creek mouth 675 metres\n  </li>\n  <li>Stein Lake 1,025 metres\n  </li>\n  <li>Elton Lake 1,825 metres\n  </li>\n  <li>Tundra Lake 1,875 metres</li>\n  <li>Lizzie Lake 1,325 metres</li>\n  <li>Blowdown Pass 2,175 metres</li>\n</ul>\n<img src=\"stein10.jpg\" alt=\"photo of Stein River in Stein Valley\" class=\"legacy-image\">\n<br>\n<strong>The Stein River and its Tributaries:</strong>\nThe main Stein River,   from Stein Lake to the Fraser River, is about 60 kilometres long   and drops about 800 metres over that distance. River levels are   highest in June and July, and also change significantly in short   periods of time due to heavy rainfalls or high temperatures in the   western end of the valley. The river contains several falls, with   the 2 largest being about 6 to 8 metres high. There are several   other waterfalls in the Park, including Cottonwood Falls, at 15   metres in height and Elton Falls which drops 60 metres and has a   cascade totalling more than 300 metres. Generally speaking, the   tributaries on the south side of the river are glacially fed, while   those on the north side drain large expanses of meadows.\n<br>\n<br>The Park contains larger lakes (Stein, Elton and Tundra), as well   as many small lakes. Tundra and Elton are headwater lakes which   are only ice-free from July through October. Elton, with its glacier   flowing into the west end of the lake and its spectacular cobalt   blue color, is one of the gems of the Park.\n<br>\n<br>Return to\n<a href=\"./\" class=\"legacy-link\">Stein Valley Nlaka’pamux  Heritage Park</a>",

The trail is in generally good condition, with only occasional deadfalls.   Some sections may be muddy or flooded during spring run-off. Be prepared for rougher,   steeper sections of trail at Devil’s Staircase and Snake Bluffs. Eight campsites   are located along this section of trail, each containing a bear-proof food cache   and a single pit toilet. All camping must be at these sites. A suspension bridge   over the Stein is located at the 13 kilometre mark, and is in good condition.   The suspension bridge has replaced the cable car.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Mid-Stein</strong>\n  (Cottonwood Creek to Stein Lake):<br>\n  In 2001, bridges were constructed over many of the creek crossings on this stretch of  trail. Three cable car crossings are located along this section of trail,  at Scudamore   Creek, near Rutledge Creek and at the east end of Stein Lake. Three designated  campsites are in place on this section of trail at Logjam, Mid-Canyon and  Stein   Lake camps. Each has a bear-proof food cache and a backcountry toilet. This area  still contains several unbridged creek crossings and steep, rugged sections  of trail.\n  <br>\n  <img src=\"stein8.jpg\" alt=\"photo of ridge above old Silver Queen Mine area in Stein Valley\" class=\"legacy-image\">\n  <br>\n  <strong>Upper Stein</strong>\n  (Stein Lake to Tundra Lake): Approximately 10.5 kilometres in length.  A rigorous hike with major elevational changes. There is no water available for  most of this hike. Above treeline, this is a route, marked in places with cairns.  There are several steep snow chutes, which are present for most (if not all)  of the year, to be crossed. There is a backcountry toilet and a food cache at the east end of Tundra Lake. The saddle above the west end of Tundra Lake is the park boundary. (Note: Tundra Lake to the Lizzie Lake trail head is approximately  12.5 kilometres then it is 12 more km along the old Lizzie Lake Forest Service Road to the trailhead.)\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Elton Lake</strong>\n  (Stein Lake to Elton Lake): Approximately 4 kilometres. A rigorous hike  with major elevational changes. There is no water available until you reach the  lake. This is a route, with no well-defined trail to follow. Good route finding  skills are a necessity. Elton Lake is a spectacular sight, with its unique cobalt  blue color, small rock island and headwall glacier.<br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Blowdown Pass</strong>\n  (Blowdown Pass to Cottonwood Creek campsite): Approximately 25 kilometres  in length. This is a well-marked trail but some stretches get quickly overgrown  with shrubs. There are steep elevational changes between Cattle Valley Creek  and the Cottonwood Creek campsite. Side trip opportunity to the old Silver Queen   Mine site (<em>Caution:</em>\n  The old open mine adit may be unstable - do not enter). There is a backcountry toilet and a food cache at the junction of the North and South Forks of Cottonwood Creek.<br>\n  <img src=\"stein13.jpg\" alt=\"photo of Park Wardens in Stein Valley\" class=\"legacy-image\">\n  <br>\n  <strong>Brimful Lake</strong>\n  (Texas Creek to Brimful Lake): Access is via the Texas Creek Forest Service Road which is closed April 15 to June 30 at km 4. The upper part of the road has not been maintained for many years.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Stryen Creek</strong>\n  (Main trail head to the Stryen Creek valley): Approximately 6.5 kilometres   to “The Forks”, with further trips available up the East (8 kilometres) and West   (5 kilometres) forks of the creek. The first kilometre or so of this trail is   confusing, but beyond that is very easy to follow and is in good condition.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Stein Traverse</strong>\n  (Main trail head to Lizzie Lake): Over 75 kilometres   in length. More often travelled in a west to east direction   to reduce elevation gains required. You must be experienced,   in excellent condition and well outfitted to undertake this   trip.\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  The far west end of the park, along the Lizzie   Lake to Stein Lake trail, is usually snowed in until mid-July.   This is a very steep, high elevation area. Under normal conditions,   this area would not be recommended outside of the mid-July to   mid-September period.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Mini-Traverse</strong>\n  (Blowdown Pass to Main Trail Head): Approximately 55 kilometres in length. See   notes above for information on sections of this route.\n  <br>\n  <br>Stein Valley Nlaka’pamux Heritage Park Wardens conduct backcountry patrols of the park.   Our Park Wardens are in the park during the summer season; if you see them along   the trail, stop and have a chat.

The main canoe launch at Marks Lake provides   parking and the most developed facilities at Kirkland Lake. For   most visitors, the Marks Lake site is a good place to begin. Beyond   this site, the road continues toward the west end of Maitland Lake,   but it gets rougher and narrower. The road becomes impassible beyond   the Marks Lake access site. From the Marks Lake parking area, you   can launch your canoe and paddle south along the west shore of the   lake to the short portage into Maitland Lake.\n<br>\n<br>Maitland Lake   is the largest lake on the chain, and is very scenic with its crystal   clear water and abundant loon population. A cabin and pit toilet   are located at the north end of the lake. To access the rest of   the chain, you will need to return to Marks Lake. From the east   end of the lake, continue over three short portages and two small   lakes known as Crane Lakes to arrive at Kirkland Lake. This is one   of the larger lakes on the chain, and home to a variety of birdlife   including Bonaparte gulls. A rocky portage leads to the first of   two small Beaverlodge lakes, which are linked by a narrow waterway   through mosses and reeds. A similar waterway, locally known as the   “African Queen Portage” comes out at Long Lake. At low water levels,   these waterways are impassible, and you may need to turn back as   there are no alternate dry land portages.\n<br>\n<br>After Long Lake,   with its deep bays and small islands, you can make a circuit of   Moose, Grebe and Canoe Lakes, in either direction. There are rustic   campsites located on the shores of Long and Canoe Lakes. These sites   can be a good base for your first night out. Please use these established   sites to reduce your impact on the surrounding vegetation.\n<br>\n<br>In early summer   when the water is high, it is possible to bypass some of the portages   and paddle through the reeds. In late summer when the water level   has dropped, paddling between the lakes is no longer possible, and   the portages must be used.\n<strong>Please do not attempt to paddle the   waterways in low water, because the moss bed will be damaged by   dragging your canoe.</strong>\nThe portages are well marked, but do not   accommodate canoe carts. Benches are located along the trails for   those requiring a rest.\n<br>\n<br>Return to:\n<a href=\"./\" class=\"legacy-link\">Moose Valley Provincial Park</a>",

The Chilcotin peoples were   traditionally semi-nomadic hunters and gatherers, and traveled seasonally   according to food availability. The Homalco peoples occupied the   Homathko River Valley below Waddington’s Canyon. There is no evidence   of trade between these groups. Traditional aboriginal routes between   the coast and the interior along the Mosley and Homathko Valleys   were used by both the Tsilhqot’in and the Homalco peoples.<br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Settlement:\n  </strong>The first non-native recorded history of the area occurred in   the mid 1800’s when Alfred Waddington and his crews began to look   for a route which would link BC’s coast with the Cariboo Goldfields.   Construction on the trail from Bute Inlet to the Fraser through   Waddington Canyon began in 1862. The first year of construction   saw over 50 km of road built, including many bridges. However, by   1863, snow and spring runoff had washed away most of the bridges.   Remains of the Waddington Road can still be found on the lower stretches   of the Homathko River.<br>\n  <br>In 1864, several of Waddington’s men were killed by some Tsilhquot’in men. The site   of this skirmish between Waddington’s men and the First Nations   is within the Protected Area, and is sometimes still known as Murderer’s   Bar.\n</p>\n<a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>Cultural Heritage</h2>\n<p></p>\n<a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>Conservation</h2>\n<p>\n  Homathko River-Tatlayoko Protected Area is one of the only protected areas in BC that spans   the transition from the wet, mild coastal climate to the dry, harsh   climate of the Chilcotin Plateau. This variability in climate results   in a wealth of different landscapes. Valley bottom areas include   extensive wetlands, and ancient hemlock, red-cedar and Douglas-fir   forests. Low elevation lakes in the area include the 23 km long   Tatlayoko Lake, with its aquamarine waters and high mountain backdrop   carved by glaciers.<br>\n  <br>The Homathko River-Tatlayoko Protected Area protects an important low elevation   wildlife corridor through the Coast Range, and is therefore critical   in sustaining wildlife populations in the surrounding area. The   wetlands along Mosley Creek provide valuable moose habitat and migration   corridors for other species, such as grizzly bear. A number of the   area’s creeks and rivers support indigenous fish populations, while   scattered wetlands provide important staging areas for waterfowl   and other birds.\n</p>\n<a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>Wildlife</h2>\n<p>\n  Wildlife habitat   in the Protected Area is remarkably diverse, incorporating moist   hemlock forests, dry Douglas-fir forests and extensive wetlands.   Old growth forests provide abundant forage and protection from deep   snow for mule deer, mountain goat, and moose during winter. Mule   deer migrate to alpine areas in summer, and moose can be found in   open aspen forests near ponds and wetlands. Alpine valleys in the   area support mountain goats, and herds of 20 or more are occasionally   seen. Grizzly bears are typically found along the main watercourses,   and also use the alpine meadows extensively in summer. The Homathko   and Mosley Valleys are important grizzly migration corridors through   the Coast Range. These areas are also used by grizzlies moving between   salmon runs on the Homathko and Chilko Rivers.<br>\n  <br>Creeks, rivers,   and wetlands also support fish, bird, and amphibian species. Wild,   indigenous bull trout are found in Mosley Creek, Dumbell Lake and   the Homathko River. Dolly varden and rainbow trout are also abundant.   A large variety of waterfowl, raptors, and songbirds are also found   in and surrounding the Protected Area, including the bald eagle,   red-tailed hawk, osprey, Canada goose, great blue heron, woodpecker,   and flycatcher. There are also trumpeter swan staging areas in the   Homathko Valley.\n</p>",

However, evidence suggests that First Nations People camped   along the Chilcotin and Fraser Rivers since time immemorial. This   archaeological evidence includes cultural depressions from pithouse   villages (kekuli) and surface evidence of stone tool debris. The   primary groups that used the area in and surrounding the Junction   Sheep Range were the Secwepemc (Shuswap), and the Ts’ilqot’in (Chilcotin).   The Chilcotin are an Athapaskan speaking Nation while the Shuswap   are a Salishan speaking Nation; both are further divided into tribal   divisions and bands. These divisions occupied distinct areas along   the Chilcotin and Fraser Rivers, and some Shuswap and Chilcotin   divisions were mutual trading partners, sharing winter villages   and fishing sites. It is also suggested that First Nations Peoples   of the Junction area had acquired horses in the latter part of the   eighteenth century prior to the arrival of the first white fur traders.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Settlement History:\n  </strong>The Chilcotin Region began its history of agricultural   settlements just as the Cariboo Gold Rush was waning in the 1860s.   Two of the earliest ranches in this area were the Cotton and Deer   Park Ranches, now amalgamated as Riske Creek Ranching. Settlement   followed the accessible bunchgrass ranges along the terraces of   the Chilcotin River between 1873 and 1893, and ranges have been   used for livestock grazing since 1873. There is also historical   evidence of mining in the area; remnants of old Chinese placer mining   activities have been found at the confluence of the Fraser and Chilcotin   Rivers. In 1973, a 4,573 hectare Wildlife Reserve, managed by the   Fish and Wildlife Branch, was established to protect the bighorn   sheep and their natural grassland habitat. This reserve was designated   as the Junction Wildlife Management Area in 1987, and was designated   a provincial park in 1995.\n</p>\n<a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>Cultural Heritage</h2>\n\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>Conservation</h2>\n<p>\n  The Junction   Sheep Range Provincial Park protects a diverse landscape ranging   from rolling grasslands and river valleys to impressive erosional   features such as cliffs and hoodoos. The park contains some of the   most natural grasslands in the Cariboo-Chilcotin, providing critical   habitat for a number of rare and endangered species. In the park   alone, there are 12 blue-listed bird, reptile and mammal species.   Grasslands account for less than 1% of BC, yet have some of the   highest diversity of plant and animal species at risk. The grasslands   within the park are nationally significant because they have not   been grazed by cattle since 1986.\n  <a href=\"conserv\" class=\"legacy-link\">Grassland   plants</a>\n  are highly sensitive to weed invasions; weeds introduced   on the vehicle undercarriage for example, may seriously threaten   grassland habitat. Fire control in grassland areas permits tree   encroachment into grasslands, another serious habitat threat. A   burning program is soon to be initiated in the park in order to   reduce encroachment, and renew the older bunchgrass that sheep find   unpalatable.\n  <br>\n  <br>Some of the   rare and endangered species found in the natural grasslands of the   Cariboo-Chilcotin are barely visible to the naked eye; some are   even microscopic. The species that occupy the ground space between   bunchgrasses are extremely vulnerable to pollution and disturbance   from trampling. These lichens and mosses form a cohesive crust called   the cyptogamic crust and though tiny, perform numerous functions   important to the ecosystem as a whole.\n  <br>\n  <br>The park features   a number of unique ecosystems and distinct landscape features, each   closely related to the area's diverse wildlife. Grasslands dominate,   though pockets of Douglas-fir on moist areas and hilltops provide   habitat for black bear and mule deer. Steep, rugged cliffs of lava,   limestone, and clay contrast sharply with the rolling grasslands.<br>\n  <br>Most notably,   the area protects critical breeding, lambing, and winter range of   the largest population of non-migratory California bighorn sheep   in the world, a blue-listed species. Approximately 500 bighorn sheep   live in the area, feeding on bunchgrass and other low growing plants,   and finding refuge from predators in the steep breaks at the edges   of grassland benches. In the past, the Junction California bighorn   sheep have also provided a source of sheep for transplants to other   areas of North America where the sheep had been extirpated.\n</p>\n<a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>Wildlife</h2>\n<p>\n  The diverse   landscape of the Junction Sheep Range Provincial Park supports a   diversity of wildlife. Many plants and animals exist at the northernmost   limit of their distribution and are, therefore, regionally significant.   Several vulnerable and threatened species are found within the park,   including the California bighorn sheep, prairie falcon, upland sandpiper,   rubber boa, and long-billed curlew. Other species found in the area   include cougar, black bear, mule deer, grouse, and owls. Large mammals   primarily utilize patches of Douglas-fir and forest/grassland edge   habitat.\n</p>",

This 20 km route spans six lakes (Deerpelt   Lake, Nazko Lake, Tanilkul Lake, Nastachi Lake, Tzazati Lake, and   Tchusiniltil Lake) and has short, easy portages. Most of the portages   are marked. There are no facilities on the canoe chain.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Deerpelt Lake</strong>\n- A small, scenic lake, Deerpelt Lake is the staging area   for the Nazko Lake Canoe Chain. There is a steep canoe launch, leading   from the campsite to the lake. A very narrow access road with poor   visibility travels along one side of Deerpelt Lake to Nazko Lake.   This road offers little room to maneuver a vehicle or turn around   and can be very slippery when wet. It is recommended that canoeists   park at Deerpelt Lake to access the canoe chain. A 50-75 m portage   leads from Deerpelt Lake to Nazko Lake.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Nazko Lake</strong>\n- One of the most popular lakes on the chain, Nazko Lake is also   the primary lake for fishing. (Power boats are allowed on Nazko   Lake). There are wetlands at either end of Nazko Lake where bald   eagles can be sighted. An 800 m portage (the longest portage on   the chain) leads from Nazko Lake to Tanilkul Lake.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Tanilkul Lake</strong>\n- At approximately 5 km long, Tanilkul Lake is the longest   lake on the chain, and perhaps the most beautiful. Tanilkul Lake   offers an abundance of wildlife viewing opportunities; American   White Pelican, mule deer, common loons, osprey, bald eagles, greater   yellowlegs, red-winged blackbird, and beaver. There are rock cliffs   that border most of the lake which create a wonderful sense of isolation.   A short 20 m portage leads from Tanilkul Lake to a small unnamed   lake. A 200 m portage leads from the unnamed lake to Nastachi Lake.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Nastachi Lake</strong>\n- This 3.5 km lake is very shallow, with water lilies and   other aquatic vegetation, making paddling difficult. Nastachi Lake   may be impassable later in the summer, depending on seasonal water   levels. The aquatic vegetation supports a diversity of bird life.   A 300 m portage leads from Nastachi Lake to Tzazati Lake. There   is a swampy section on the portage as you near Tzazati Lake.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Tzazati Lake</strong>\n- This 3 km long lake has a primarily forested shoreline, with marshes   evident only near the lake inlets and outlets.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Nazko River/Tchusiniltil Lake</strong>\n- This is the final section of the canoe chain, approximately   7 km in length, with one portage on the river. The slow current   of this narrow river makes canoeing easy, and the nearby shore provides   excellent wildlife viewing.\n<br>\n<br>",

Five kilometres of trail leads to the park  boundary where the trail continues for another five and a half kilometres.  An old fire access trail, built in the 1930’s during a significant fire,  continues several more kilometres before gradually disappearing. The trail  eventually gained the ridgeline on the east boundary of the park before joining  another trail at Mt. Sloan. The lower 12 km of the Granby Trail is the only  section of trail in the park that has seen recent improvements which were done  by the Ministry of Forests and Granby Wilderness Society volunteers.<br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Height of Land Route:</strong>\n  A long route weaves in and out of the park  along the western northern and eastern boundaries. This route is  located mostly in the alpine and sub-alpine and has been used by  hunters, horse back riders and miners in the past. Much of the  route is overgrown and impassable. Beginning on the western boundary,  a horse trail in good condition leads up from the end of the Goatskin  Creek road to a cabin at the height of land. The route then crosses  into the park and heads north along the height of land skirting  east around Reith Lakes and ending up at Lighting Peak, a distance  of roughly 11 kilometres. From Lightning Peak to Mt. Scaia are  horse trails through meadows that wind in and out of the park.  The hike around the headwaters of the Granby River is roughly 12  kilometres and offers excellent vistas. The eastern section follows  the height of land from Mount Scaia to Franklin Creek, passing  over Mount Young and Mount Sloan in a distance of nearly 40 kilometres.<br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Mt.

The primary mine in the area was the Grange Mine, a gold   mine located just outside Edge Hills Provincial Park at the mouth   of Kelly Creek. The mine was in operation until the late 1940's.   Today, there are numerous shafts in the area once used in placer   and hard rock mining.

Grassland plant communities are among the rarest ecosystems   in the province, and provide habitat for a large proportion of threatened   and endangered species. The dry climate of grasslands is due to   the rain shadow effect on the leeward side of the Coast Mountains.   Air masses drop most of their moisture before rising over the mountains,   resulting in a much drier climate on the interior side of the mountains.   Grasslands occur at low elevations where temperatures are higher,   and snow fall is minimal, adding to the already dry climate in the   rain shadow.<br>\n  <br>Edge Hills Provincial   Park incorporates a landscape that stretches over a wide range in   elevation from sagebrush grasslands rising from the riverbanks of   the Fraser to Douglas-fir forests at mid elevations, and moister   spruce and lodgepole pine forests at upper elevations.\n</p>\n<a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>Wildlife</h2>\n<p>\n  The park is   managed jointly with\n  <a href=\"../marble_ran/\" class=\"legacy-link\">Marble Range   Provincial Park</a>\n  to protect migration corridors of California   bighorn sheep between low elevation winter habitat along the Fraser   River, and higher elevation habitat in the Marble Range. Wildlife   found in the park includes mule deer, moose, and the occasional   black bear. The park protects several rare and endangered species,   including the spotted bat, long-billed curlew, California bighorn   sheep, and flammulated owl. The park also borders the Fraser River,   which supports important salmon stocks.<br>\n  <br>Every year,   California bighorn sheep migrate between alpine areas in Marble   Range Provincial Park and steep cliffs of the Fraser River canyon   in Edge Hills Provincial Park. The migration is dictated by food   availability. Sheep will winter in the warmth of the canyon, where   tender green shoots begin to grow early in the season. Here, the   sheep also encounter less snow, and have access to steep and rugged   terrain for protection from predators. In early summer, the sheep   migrate to alpine areas in the Marble Range. Over the past 40 to   50 years, many of these routes have been abandoned, with only a   few routes remaining. A three year study was led by the Clinton   and District Outdoor Sportsmen Association in conjunction with Ministry   of Water, Land, and Air Protection, to determine the location of   the migration routes, and to assist in future management.\n</p>",

But horses’   hooves each exert over 1500 p.s.i. of pressure every time they hit   the ground, which can really impact this delicate grassland ecosystem.   The\n<a href=\"index\" class=\"legacy-link\">Churn   Creek Management Plan</a>\nwas a public process that came up with   some solutions that will allow for recreational horse riding over   the long term and with no increased impacts on the environment.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Management Plan Guidelines:</strong>\n<ul>\n  <li>Large groups   (twelve or more horses) must\n    <a href=\"/commercial-use/policies\">register   with BC Parks</a>\n    before leaving on their trip. They will be registered   and provided with the “<a href=\"https://leavenotrace.ca/\">Leave No Trace</a>” code of ethics listed below.</li>\n  <li>Groups of   twelve or more horses must stay on roads and trails. Smaller groups   may travel throughout the Protected Area.</li>\n  <li>Feed: Grazing is not permitted. This eliminates competition with wildlife and   cattle for limited forage. Either bring your own weed-free pelleted   feed, or arrange to purchase hay at the Empire Valley Ranch.</li>\n  <li>Horseback riders are encouraged to use the Calving Barn as a staging area   and camp. Corrals, the barn and a pit toilet are provided. Water   is available in a nearby creek.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<strong>LEAVE NO TRACE ETHICS</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Some Special Notes For Horse Users</strong>\n<br>\n<br>The seven principles of “<a href=\"https://leavenotrace.ca/\">Leave No Trace</a>” Ethics have been adapted for use by horse riders   at Churn Creek Protected Area. These Ethics will help you plan your   visit so that you can minimize your impact upon the environment   and keep Churn Creek accessible to riders in years to come.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>1. Plan Ahead and Prepare</strong>\n<ul>\n  <li>Reduce the   impact by limiting your equipment and by taking only the minimum   number of animals necessary. Take only experienced, gentle and   fit horses. Practice backcountry packing and travel techniques   with your horses at home before heading out.</li>\n  <li>Ensure group   members have compatible expectations. Plan your route carefully.   Familiarize yourselves with the regulations, potential hazards,   and climate of the area. Plan meals accurately, and repackage   into reusable containers to reduce weight and potential garbage.   Pack out what you pack in.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>2. Concentrate Use in Resistant Areas</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Camping</strong>:\n<ul>\n  <li>The heaviest   impact will tend to be around camp, so it is best to choose a   campsite that can “take it”. The best place in Churn   Creek is the Calving Barn, as it is set up with parking spaces   for trailers and corrals for the horses, and has had so much use   that the ground is hardened already. When selecting a backcountry   campsite, please choose one that appears established, to avoid   proliferation of new impacts. Camp well away from water sources.   Avoid places where impact is just beginning. Hard sand or gravel   surfaces are the best, followed by the thicker grasses of the   upper grasslands. Lower elevation bunchgrass ecosystems are the   most delicate because the lichen crust between grass clumps is   very easily disturbed by tires, hooves or boots. Besides, these   areas are well defended by prickly pear cacti!</li>\n  <li>Use lightweight   camping equipment - fewer packhorses will be needed and there   will be less impact on the ground.</li>\n  <li>Horses should   be tied up overnight to a high-line. Do not use hobbles, pickets   or temporary corrals, because grazing is not permitted in Churn   Creek. Avoid tying stock to trees except for short periods or   in an emergency. Put hobbles on stock that paws while high-lined.   This method of restraining horses will keep them from grazing   and from damaging tree roots by trampling. Choose a dry, hard   area. Stretch a rope just above horse head height between two   live trees of at least 20 cm (8\") in diameter. Wind the ends   several times around or use wide nylon straps, to avoid girdling   the trees. Tie the lead lines at intervals along the high line.   These must not be free to move along the high-line so horses don't   get tangled up. They should be short enough that the horses cannot   step over them or wind them around their necks. A swivel is required   at each station on the highline for tying the lead shank.</li>\n  <li>You can take   a horse to water but you can’t make it drink, so take the water   to the horse instead using a canvas bucket. Wetlands and creek   edges are very important wildlife areas and quite susceptible   to trampling, so keep horses away except when fording.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Travel</strong>:\n<ul>\n  <li>Groups with   twelve or more horses must stay on Churn Creek’s many trails and   old roads and this is recommended for smaller groups too. These   routes are well marked and interesting; most are closed to vehicular   traffic. If you encounter muddy areas, please go straight through   them. Riding around the edges just increases the extent of the   mud bog. Off trail travel risks harming the delicate soil and   vegetation of the grasslands. If you must do it, spread out the   horses laterally. One party travelling single file is enough to   leave a lasting impact, which will in turn tempt others to follow.</li>\n  <li>During rest   breaks, please stop off the trail on a durable surface. Horses   may be tied to sturdy trees for short periods; please wrap lead   rope twice around the trunk to avoid girdling the tree. Tend to   the horses often, as a distraught horse can quickly damage tree   roots by pawing or trampling the ground. Tie and hobble restless   stock to prevent pawing.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>3. Pack It In, Pack It Out</strong>\n<ul>\n  <li>Pack out   all your own litter and if you see litter left by others, consider   bringing that out too. Reduce the amount of garbage you generate   by pre-planning and repackaging meals into daily rations. Only   paper may be burned in your campfire. Don’t burn laminated foil   or plastics, they leave a residue and can attract bears. Here   is more information on\n    <a href=\"/plan-your-trip/visit-responsibly/staying-safe\">bear   safety</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>4. Properly Dispose of What You Can’t Pack Out</strong>\n<br>\n<blockquote>\n  <strong>Human Waste:</strong>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Besides being   disgusting, raw human feces can carry a number of dangerous pathogens,   Giardia, the cause of\n      <a href=\"/plan-your-trip/visit-responsibly/staying-safe\">Beaver   Fever</a>\n      being only one. Proper disposal is very important. Never   use streams or lakes as sewers! Use outhouses where they are provided.   Otherwise dig a cat-hole latrine for your group to use. Locate   it at least 100m (300ft) from water and well away from camp. It   should be a trench 15 cm (6\") deep - no deeper because the   topsoil is where waste is most quickly decomposed. Sprinkle soil   over after each use, and when leaving camp, replace remaining   soil and naturalize it with organic debris. Toilet paper should   be used sparingly, then burned in a hot fire or bagged and carried   out. Urine is less of a problem because it is sterile, but go   away from camp and water sources.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <strong>Horse Waste:</strong>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Horses’ waste   is much safer than humans’, but it can carry viable weed seeds,   so start your horses on the pelleted feed the day before leaving.   Remove manure piles from camp and scatter them in the bush before   you move on.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <strong>Waste Water:</strong>\n  <ul>\n    <li>It is important   to prevent contamination of water supplies from food scraps or   soap. Wash yourself and your dishes and clothes at least 100m   from water sources. Avoid using even biodegradable soap as it   leaves unnatural residues. Strain out food particles from dishwater   and pack them out with the garbage. Dig a sump hole down to mineral   soil and pour grey water into it. Fill in and conceal the hole   on leaving camp.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <strong>Hunting Waste:</strong>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Gut piles   and hides should be left well away from campsites and trails,   as they will attract scavengers such as ravens, coyotes and bears.</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n<strong>\n  5. Use Fire Responsibly</strong>\n<ul>\n  <li>For cooking,   portable stoves are far better than the traditional campfire -   more efficient, quicker, safer and controllable. They are recommended   as the best “<a href=\"https://leavenotrace.ca/\">Leave No Trace</a>” solution. However, there's nothing   like the crackle of a welcoming evening campfire. Churn Creek's   climate is very dry, so there are often campfire bans during the   summer season. Ordinarily, campfires are permitted in established   fire rings. At the Calving Barn, no firewood is provided, so bring   your own. In backcountry areas, collect dead and down wood only.   It should be no thicker than an adult’s wrist so it can burn completely   down to ashes. Fires must be less than 50 cm (20\") tall -   and smaller is better. Never burn waste other than paper. Extinguish   the fire completely before you leave camp. You should be able   to put your hand in the ashes and feel no warmth.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>6. Leave What You Find</strong>\n<ul>\n  <li>Let others   experience the same sense of discovery you had upon finding interesting   objects like shed antlers, colourful rocks, wildflowers, old buildings,   etc. Leave things where you found them. It is illegal to remove   or disturb such things.</li>\n  <li>Also, avoid   damage to live trees and plants. Don’t cut them for any reason.   Bring along lightweight camp furniture like sleeping pads, and   tents with aluminum poles. You'll be much more comfortable, and   you won't need to cut poles or boughs. Even nail holes in trees   can introduce disease.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>7. Be Considerate of Others</strong>\n<ul>\n  <li>There are   some in-holdings of private property within Churn Creek Protected   Area. Respect them. Stay off the hay fields at Empire Valley Ranch.   Call ahead if you wish to purchase hay from the ranch headquarters   - it’s a working ranch, and the permittees don't have time or   space to deal with unexpected visitors.<br>\n  </li>\n  <li>Be cautious   when you encounter other visitors. They may be unfamiliar with   horses and the appropriate behaviour around them - and your stock   might become nervous. Motorists, hikers, mountain bikers and hunters   also use the protected area. Try engaging them in conversation.   This helps to reassure your equines.</li>\n  <li>Dogs must   be under strict control at all times, and on a leash where it's   posted. If your dog tends to harass wildlife or livestock, leave   it at home!</li>\n  <li>California   bighorn sheep and other eye-catching wildlife live at Churn Creek.   Use binoculars and telephoto lenses to get a good view. If you   are close enough that the animals show signs of distress, you   are too close.</li>\n  <li>People come   to the grasslands to enjoy the sense of serenity and wilderness.   Do keep noise levels to a minimum.</li>\n</ul>\nReturn to\n<a href=\"./\" class=\"legacy-link\">Churn Creek Protected Area page</a>",

At this time, the fur trade had already   declined due to waning populations of furbearers. The discovery   of gold in the Cariboo further increased the non-native presence   in the Churn Creek area. The first nonnative residents of the Churn   Creek area were pack train operators bringing supplies to the gold   fields at Barkerville and Quesnel Forks. They were followed in the   1880s by an influx of Chinese miners, who created a dam at Koster   Lake, and ran ditches to placer mines on the Fraser River. Around   the same time, sheep and cattle ranchers began to run their herds   in the area. What we know today as the Empire Valley Ranch began   as many small ranches and homesteads. By 1910, several ranching   families built the Empire Valley's first school near Brown Lake.   At this time, a bridge was constructed over the Fraser River, replacing   the ferry and cable car that had operated since the 1860s. The bridge   still features the original towers and cables, but it is now rebuilt   to provincial standards.<br>\n  <br>By the 1940s,   gold was discovered on Blackdome Mountain by Lawrence Frenier. However,   ranching remained the economic mainstay, with some logging as well,   until Churn Creek was designated a protected area in 1995.\n</p>\n<a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"culture\" href=\"/\"></a>Culture</h2>\n<p>\n  The Churn Creek   Protected Area has a long history of First Nations use extending   back nearly 7,000 years. Archaeological evidence includes cultural   depressions from pithouse (kekuli) villages, and surface remnants   of stone tools. The principal First Nations groups occupying the   Churn Creek area were the Ts’ilhqot’in (Chilcotin) and Secwepemc (Shuswap),   each further divided into tribal divisions and bands.<br>\n  <br>Research suggests   that a distinct culture based on hunting and gathering had developed   on the Interior Plateau as early as 7,000 years ago, with river   fishing developing sometime later. It is suggested that First Nations   peoples lived in essentially permanent pit house villages during   the winter months, and were largely nomadic during the remainder   of the year to procure food and other resources. Some divisions   of the Chilcotin and Shuswap peoples were important trading partners,   and often shared winter villages and fishing sites.<br>\n  <br>As days lengthened   in the spring, people ventured from these permanent villages and   began gathering fresh roots and vegetation. Summer homes were structures   made with lodge poles and a bark or mat covering; hides were considered   too valuable to use for this purpose. Midsummer was trout fishing   time, followed by berry picking and salmon fishing. Fishing - with   dipnets made of roots, gaffs, and fish traps - was carried out at   Perkins Rock and at the confluence of Churn Creek and the Fraser   River. Both salmon and sturgeon were plentiful. In the late autumn,   people hunted for deer, elk and bighorn sheep. (During the early   1900s, moose moved south and displaced elk from the Cariboo-Chilcotin.)   Hunters used bows of wood and sinew, and arrows with points chipped   from obsidian. Deer hunters used such techniques as calling and   setting up corrals. Processing food so people could survive the   winter was a vital and continuing task during the summer and fall   seasons.\n  <br>\n  <br>At the low elevations   of the bunchgrass grasslands, spring arrives early. First Nations   people gathered and ate such plants as mariposa lily, nodding onion,   and prickly pear cactus. Big sagebrush bark could be woven into   cloth, while the leaves were used in a medicinal tea, and were burned   for their purifying smoke. At higher elevations, arrow-leafed balsamroot,   Saskatoon berries, and chokecherries provided nutriment. People   would deliberately burn tracts of grassland to encourage the regrowth   of herbs, and prevent the encroachment of Douglas-fir trees onto   the grasslands.\n  <br>\n  <br>It is an offence   under the\n  <em>Heritage Conservation Act</em>\n  to damage or remove artifacts   from any cultural heritage site.\n</p>\n<a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>Conservation</h2>\n<p>\n  The primary   role of the Churn Creek Protected Area is to conserve and restore   nationally significant grassland ecosystems and wildlife populations.   These grasslands represent the northern extent of large bunchgrass   grassland ecosystems with their centre of distribution in central   Washington. What makes Churn Creek so ecologically significant is   its mosaic of grasslands, shrub-steppe, wetlands, kettle lakes,   and dry open forests. Such diversity of habitats supports tremendous   diversity of living creatures. This diversity is distinctive in   the province's protected areas system, making Churn Creek the most   significant grassland protected area west of the Rockies.<br>\n  <br>The Churn Creek   grasslands are a product of the “rain shadow” created   by British Columbia’s coastal mountains, and are therefore characterized   by dry, hot summers, and cold, low-snowfall winters. These grasslands   are located in deeply incised, heat-trapping valleys. In this area,   annual rainfall and snowfall increases with elevation, with annual   precipitation ranging from 300 to 400 mm. By early July, drought   conditions typically prevail. On most low- to mid-elevation sites,   summer droughts are too severe for trees to become established;   forests are restricted to moister sites such as steep, cool aspects,   and shady ravines. Drought tolerant perennial bunchgrasses, scattered   shrubs, and microbiotic soil crusts dominate the landscape.\n  <a href=\"lichen\" class=\"legacy-link\">The ecology of grassland plants and the lichen crust</a>\n  is extremely interesting. Many grassland plants are highly sensitive   to disturbance - please do not remove them or destroy their habitat.   Ground lichens can take over ten years to recover from damage caused   by one vehicle. This damage is intensified by each passing vehicle,   allowing erosion to set in.<br>\n  <br>Driving over   the grasslands is an offence punishable by law. Please obey any   posted signs showing a vehicle in a circle with a line drawn through   it; this sign means No Motorized Vehicles Beyond This Point.\n</p>\n<a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>Wildlife</h2>\n<p>\n  Although grasslands   occupy less than 2% of the province’s land area, they support a   third of the province’s threatened and endangered species. The grasslands   of the Cariboo-Chilcotin contain a tremendous diversity of wildlife   species. The Churn Creek Protected Area captures much of this diversity,   stretching 25 km along the Fraser River and incorporating arid grasslands,   cool, moist deep ravines and riparian areas, grassland/forest edges,   dry Douglas-fir forests, and moist high elevation pine and spruce   forests. Some of the threatened wildlife found in the Churn Creek   area includes\n  <a href=\"lewis\" class=\"legacy-link\">Lewis’ woodpecker</a>, Brewer’s   sparrow, sage thrasher, peregrine falcon, Swainson’s hawk, bobolink,   flammulated owl, pallid bat, fringed myotis, rubber boa, and the   gopher snake. The Protected Area also includes critical winter habitat   for approximately 2500 mule deer, year-round habitat for 300-500\n  <a href=\"lewis\" class=\"legacy-link\">California Bighorn sheep</a>, and   populations of black bear, cougar, bobcat, lynx, and small mammals.   Significant concentrations of bird, bat, amphibian, and reptile   species can also be found in the Churn Creek grasslands; a number   of these species are at their northern breeding limits.<br>\n  <br>In addition   to its diversity of terrestrial habitats ranging from grassland   to open forest, Churn Creek incorporates a number of kettle lakes,   streams, and large creeks. Since the small lakes, marshes, and creeks   either remain ice-free or thaw early in the spring, they also provide   important staging and stopover areas for migratory waterfowl, and   year-round habitat for muskrats, reptiles and amphibians.<br>\n  <br>Visitors should   be aware that the Protected Area includes black bear habitat, and   that black bears are an important component of the Churn Creek Protected   Area. Never feed or approach bears or other wildlife.\n</p>",

In 1956, the park boundaries were revised and the Entiako area was   no longer protected. In the 1980s forest harvesting was deferred   from most of the Entiako area until studies on caribou winter habitat   requirements could be completed. In 1991 the Entiako Land and Resource   Use Plan was started to address the caribou habitat and forest harvesting   conflict. After 2 years, this responsibility was taken on by the   newly initiated Vanderhoof Land and Resource Management Plan and   the Lakes Land and Resource Management Plan. Over 48,261 hectares   of park was designated in 1999 under the Vanderhoof LRMP and 73,268   hectares of protected area were designated in 2000 under the Lakes   LRMP.\n</p>\n<a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>Cultural Heritage</h2>\n<p>\n  Entiako Park   lies with the Ulkatcho Traditional Use Area, while the northern   portion of Entiako Park lies within the Cheslatta Carrier Land Claim.\n  <br>\n  <br>Historically,   there were likely 1,500 First Nations people living in the areas   around Tetachuk and Eutsuk Lakes, with a major village site near   the Redfern Rapids. They relied on caribou and fish for food and   used fire to increase berry production. The area of Entiako Park   was likely used mainly during the snow-free period for hunting and   fishing.<br>\n  <br>The first European   contact in west-central BC occurred in the 1700s by boat and by   land. They brought new tools, diseases and the fur trades to the   area with great impacts on the local First Nations. Both the Carrier   and Ulkatcho spent more time during the winter trapping for fur   in the plateau of Entiako Park. In 1838 a small pox epidemic wiped   out a large portion of the First Nations people, with several other   epidemics to follow into the early 1900s.\n  <br>\n  <br>When the Kenney   dam was constructed, several village sites, seasonal camps and trails   were flooded. The Bella Coola trail, which runs from Aslin Creek   in Entiako Park to the village site of Ulkatcho to Bella Coola,   was an important trade route for coastal and interior First Nations   until it was flooded, cutting off communications between groups.<br>\n  <br>Several of the   place names in the Entiako area are based on the traditional names   given to them by First Nations people. The following is a sample   of some of the local places, and their meaning in the Carrier language:<br>\n  Natalkuz Lake Lake of small winds<br>\n  Entiako Lake Lake with a rusty creek<br>\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n  En = Lake<br>\n  Ko = River<br>\n  Euchu Lake – First Lake<br>\n  Tetachuk Lake – Sick water<br>\n  Capoose Lake – Bald part of mountain where no trees grow.</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>Conservation</h2>\n<p>\n  Entiako Park   is located within the Nazko Upland, Bulkley Basin and Nechako Upland   Ecosections.

There are also   several rare plant communities and several species of lichens that   are potentially rare.<br>\n  <br>Lichens are   abundant in the park where the cold and dry growing conditions are   inhospitable and most plant species are unable to survive. Terrestrial   lichens are the primary winter forage for the Woodland caribou in   the area (see wildlife section).\n</p>\n<a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>Wildlife</h2>\n<p>\n  Entiako Park   is the winter home for the Tweedsmuir-Entiako caribou population.   Prior to the 1900s, caribou were found throughout British Columbia.   In the early 1900s, the caribou population around the province began   declining. Caribou have been declared “threatened” in   the Southern Mountains National Ecological Area by the Committee   on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) and today   the Tweedsmuir-Entiako herd is one of only three caribou populations   found in west central BC. In the Entiako area, several factors may   have influenced the decline of caribou numbers. The construction   of the Kenney Dam in the early 1950s restricted the movements and   migration of the herd, and some caribou drowned attempting to cross   new bodies of water to their usual habitats. In the 1970s harvesting   began in the area, which may have disturbed and fragmented their   habitat range, while over-hunting also played a factor during this   time. Today the Tweedsmuir-Entiako herd is estimated at 400 individuals.<br>\n  <br>Predator-prey   relationships exist in the Entiako between caribou, moose, grizzly   bears and wolves.

In 1997, the Fort St. John Land and Resource   Management Plan confirmed the importance of protected status for   the Graham-Laurier area.\n</p>\n<a name=\"cultural\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>Cultural Heritage</h2>\n<p></p>\n<a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"conservation\" href=\"/\"></a>Conservation</h2>\n<p>\n  Graham-Laurier   Park provides landscape transition from the foothills to the Rocky   Mountains through representation of the Misinchinka Ranges and Peace   Foothills ecosections. The Misinchinka Ranges, found in the western   portion of the park, are unlike the rest of the Rocky Mountains   due to their lower elevation and relief and reduced alpine and valley   glaciation. The Peace Foothills are a blocky mountainous area within   the rainshadow of the Misinchinka.<br>\n  <br>The Misinchinka   Ranges are composed of schists of late Precambrian and Cambrian   age, which lie in a belt along the eastern side of the Rocky Mountain   Trench. These rocks are unable to support the sheer slopes and castle-like   forms that are characteristic of other Rocky Mountain Ranges.<br>\n  <br>Only short stretches   of the Graham River are actually within the park. These include   the upper drainage from its source to just downstream of Poutang   Creek, the Christina Falls area and stretch upstream of Crying Girl   Prairie. The southern portion of the park houses the Needham Creek   drainage and a portion of the Emmerslund Creek drainage. The Graham   River is a tributary of the Halfway River, which empties into the   Peace River; the Peace is part of the Mackenzie River watershed,   which ultimately empties into the Arctic Ocean. Lady Laurier, a   picturesque alpine lake, is one of the few waterbodies within the   park and is surrounded by Mount Lady Laurier, the highest peak in   the park.<br>\n  <br>The park has   three biogeoclimatic zones within its boundaries. These zones illustrate   the transition from river bottom, old-growth forests to sub-alpine   and alpine areas. Only a small portion of the Boreal Black and White   Spruce zone is found in the southeast corner of the park along the   Graham River and contains extensive stands of old-growth habitat.   The Engelmann Spruce Sub-alpine Fir occurs along the lower elevations   of each drainage. This is a sub-alpine zone characterized by severe   climatic conditions; heavy growth of Engelmann spruce and sub-alpine   fir thins rapidly to scrubby sub-alpine fir. This vegetation is   replaced by the Alpine Tundra zone at higher elevations.\n</p>\n<a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>Wildlife</h2>\n<p>\n  A diverse variety   of wildlife inhabits this mountain landscape. The area provides   high quality habitat for moose, elk, stone sheep and mountain goat.   The abundance of prey supports predator species such as wolves and   grizzly and black bears. Other important wildlife includes furbearers   such as marten, fisher, weasels and wolverines. Information on small   mammals, amphibians, birds, invertebrates and reptiles is relatively   unknown.<br>\n  <br>The Graham River   and its tributaries have very high fisheries values. Inventories   of the Graham River have identified bull trout and slimy sculpin.   Arctic grayling is found in Lady Laurier Lake, while rainbow trout   can be found at Needham Creek. Christina Falls is a natural barrier   to fish migration and, as a result, populations in the rest of the   park are genetically isolated.\n</p>",

Lichens, from common species   to the extremely rare, mushrooms, mosses and a huge array of vascular   plants thrive in this harsh yet inviting landscape. BC Parks has   taken steps to protect the integrity of Jackman Flats by regulating   access, relocating trails from sensitive areas and working with   the locals to foster an understanding of the areas uniqueness. From   a conservation perspective, Jackman Flats proves that “good   things do indeed come in small packages.”\n</p>\n<a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"wildlife\" href=\"/\"></a>Wildlife</h2>\n<p>\n  The dry, relatively   open nature of Jackman Flats Provincial Park is not considered to   be prime wildlife habitat, although it is recognized as important   winter range. Caribou are no longer present in the valley bottom   but in years gone by, they played an important role in the diversity   and distribution of the area's many lichen species.<br>\n  <br>While the caribou   have since called the higher elevations home, a number of species   indicative to the west slopes of the Rocky Mountains can still be   found in Jackman Flats Provincial Park. Birds in particular use   the relatively open spaces and diversity of plant life in Jackman   Flats. Many species can be found here throughout the seasons.<br>\n  <br>The sandy nature   of Jackman Flats makes animal tracks quite apparent and one can   easily determine a who’s who of the area’s species by observing   tracks adjacent to the many walking trails.\n</p>",

Pope was surveying a route for the Overland Telegraph   Line. He was separated from his party and had to spend the night   alone on the mountain, which became known as Mount Pope thereafter.<br>\n  <br>In the 1920s   a telegraph line was put in when once again the peak was in use   as a lookout point, this time as a Forest Service fire lookout.   The lookout was removed in 1972 and the trail to the peak was designated   as recreational trail in 1983.
