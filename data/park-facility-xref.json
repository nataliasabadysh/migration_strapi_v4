This campground is laid out in a series of three terraces overlooking Okanagan Lake. The sites are large and well spaced with lawn and trees in between for improved privacy. The sites are located only on the lake side of the roads which increases privacy and allows for better views of the lake. The campsite pads are gravel and have fire rings and picnic tables. Wide, well packed trails lead to pit toilets and in between the terraces.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The\n  <strong>South Campground</strong>\n  has 96 sites, 94 of which are reservable, the remaining two are available on a first-come, first-served basis. There is a gatehouse at the entrance to the campground where guests must register. The gate is open until snowfall with winter rates in effect though no services are provided. This is a very different campground than the north campground. All of the sites are at lake level and very close together though there is variation in site layout. Some sites are long, narrow gravel and back onto the hillside. These sites are close together but still separated by trees and shrubs. Other sites are long, narrow and paved with the picnic table and fire ring located behind the site down three or four concrete stairs to a treed lawn area. A third style is short but wide gravel where a tow vehicle must be parked beside the trailer. These sites are not suitable for motorhomes or long trailers. These sites are separated only by cement parking barriers and are similar to double sites. The beauty of this campground is the easy beach access from all sites and the large treed lawn areas shared by some of the sites. There is a phone by the shower building.\n  <br>\n</p>\n<div>\n  Vehicle Accessible Camping Fee: $35.00 per party/night\n</div>\n<div>\n  BC Senior’s Rate (day after Labour Day to June 14 only): $17.50 per\n  <strong>senior party/</strong>night.

Access to this small bay of coarse sand is by boat, 7.5 km from the boat launch at Texas Creek. There are 10 walk-in sites with fire rings, two picnic tables and two benches. The forested uplands rise steeply off the beach and are broken up by rocky outcrops. There is evidence of historical use in the form of two old cabin sites belonging to miner Ole Johnson for whom the site is named. There are excellent swimming, fishing and hiking opportunities.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Peter Lake</strong>\n  has been used as a backcountry camp by past users. There is room for three tents beside the lake. There are no other facilities. There is no beach and swimming opportunities are limited. The lake contains rainbow trout and brook trout. There are opportunities for hiking up the ridge south of the lake for views into the Sandner Creek drainage.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Xenia Lake</strong>\n  has an old Forest Service Recreation site. There are two pit toilets and five picnic tables.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Troy Creek</strong>\n  is located at the extreme northwest corner of Christina Lake 10 km from the Texas Creek boat launch or 11.3 km hiking along the Deer Point/Troy Creek Trail. This small bay has a rocky shoreline backed by a mixed forest with some exceptional Western red cedar and Douglas fir. An old cabin provides evidence of past use of the site. There are great views across the lake and to the north as well as good fishing. There is one pit toilet and five picnic tables. A trail leads up to Xenia Lake.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Parson Creek</strong>\n  is located on the west side of Christina Lake opposite Deer Point 6 km from the Texas Creek boat launch accessible only by boat.

There is one pit toilet and two picnic tables.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Treadmill Creek</strong>\n  is located on the west side of Christina Lake 5 km from the Texas Creek boat launch. This large beach of coarse sand is sheltered from prevailing south winds making it a great spot for swimming and fishing. It offers an excellent view of Sandner-Troy Creek at the head of the lake. The land slopes away from the beach in a series of terraces. There are two pit toilets and four picnic tables.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Axel Johnson</strong>\n  is located on the west side of Christina Lake 3 km from the Texas Creek boat launch. This isolated bay has a long sandy beach making it a good spot for swimming and waterskiing. There are views across the lake of rock slides. There are two pit toilets and four picnic tables.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Starchuck Beach</strong>\n  is located on the west side of Christina Lake almost opposite of Texas Creek.

This location consists of an information shelter just inside the gate and trails that access the upland portions of the park and also loop around to link with both the Cosens Bay and the Jade and Juniper Bay parking areas. The trail to the other two parking areas is wide and easy to follow, while other trails are less developed. The trails from Red Gate are ideal for hiking, walking dogs on leashes, and biking.\n  <strong>This parking area is located outside of the Park and is maintained by the District of Coldstream</strong>.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Cosens Bay Gate</strong>\n  has a space for approximately 20 vehicles. This is the closest parking area to Cosens Bay. Although Cosens Bay Road continues on into the park it is primarily for traffic accessing private properties outside the park, or those parking at the Climbers Parking Lot. A 3 km trail leads from the parking lot to day-use facilities at Cosens Bay. There is an information shelter and a pit toilet at the start of the trail. Access to the Okanagan High Rim Trail is also from this parking area. Cosens Bay has a large beach of coarse sand that extends into the water, making swimming a treat. Picnic tables are situated along the beach beside the fringe of cottonwood trees that separate the beach from the surrounding grasslands. There are pit toilets where the trail reaches the beach. The trail to Cosens Bay is ideal for hiking, walking dogs on a leash, biking, or horseback riding.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Twin Bays (Yellow) Gate</strong>\n  is the largest parking area in the park, and can accommodate a large number of vehicles. There are information shelters and a wheelchair-accessible pit toilet near the parking area. A 600m paved trail runs down a gradual slope to Juniper Bay. There is a bench along the way. At Juniper Bay there are 11 tables on cement pads spread out across an irrigated lawn shaded by a few large Ponderosa pines. There is a BBQ stand beside one of the tables. The tables and lawns overlook the large beach of fine sand which is a great spot for swimming on a hot Okanagan day. Shrubs and trees cover the small rocky headland at one end of the bay. Also situated on the headland just off the lawn is a stone and concrete interpretive display with information on native vegetation and wildlife.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The trail to Jade Bay splits from the paved trail about 20 metres from the parking lot. This is a wide gravel trail with a moderately steep slope. It is about 500 metres to the beach. The trail passes through Ponderosa pine with a thick under story of young Douglas fir and shrubs. There is a pit toilet beside the trail 50 metres before the beach. A narrow pebbly beach is rimmed by grass, on which are four picnic tables. The beach is smaller than at Juniper Bay. A short trail along the lake links the two day-use areas. Jade and Juniper Bay is ideal for hiking and beach activities.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Climbers Parking Lot</strong>\n  was constructed in 2013 with assistance from the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, and is located about 5km down Cosens Bay Road from Cosens Bay Gate. The park’s newest parking area was created to provide an acceptable area for climbers, hikers and mountain bikers to leave their vehicles and avoid the need to park along or off the road. The parking lot is located at the Climbers Trail Trailhead, but also provides a great starting point for those accessing the Cosens Creek multi-use trail network.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Pets/domestic animals must be on a leash at all times. Pet Beaches are located about a kilometre down the Crest Trail, and at the eastern end of Cosens Bay.\n</p>",

At this shelter are self-registration envelopes and a metal vault. Upon arrival, campers should fill out the registration form and deposit their fee in the vault. This is for all three camping areas. To reduce the visitor impact on the park, please view the following\n  <a href=\"camping-ethics\" class=\"legacy-link\">\n    camping ethics</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Quiniscoe Lake</strong>\n  has 30 sites designated by number posts. The sites are spread out along the southern shore of the lake amongst Engelmann spruce, Lyall’s larch and Sub-alpine fir. Boulders and rock outcroppings are strewn about the area, evidence of the area’s glacial history. The sites feature framed earth tent pads to minimize the impacts of camping by keeping people in designated areas. The sites are grouped together in clusters of three or four in order to share the 12 picnic tables and 13 fire rings. There are four pit toilets in the campground, one is near the lodge access road, a second is behind the ranger cabin between sites 4 and 7 and the other two are further along the lake beside the trail to sites 21–25. A firewood corral is located near the lodge access road approximately 100m from the campsites. Campers are reminded to conserve firewood. There are four wire mesh food caches on the ground to protect supplies from rodents and birds. They are not bear proof.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Lake of the Woods</strong>\n  has 28 sites with framed earth tent pads along the northeast shore of the lake amidst smaller fir and larch trees. As a result, the sites are more open and less shaded than at Quiniscoe. The terrain is similarly rocky. This is a more rustic campground with two pit toilets and no tables or fire rings. Fires are prohibited. The location of the sites affords spectacular views of Lakeview, Pyramid and Quiniscoe Mountains, as well the jagged peaks of Grimface Mountain, the Macabre Tower and the Boxcar. There are no food caches available at this campground.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Pyramid Lake</strong>\n  is the smallest and quietest of the campgrounds with 12 sites. The lake is nestled between the two sloping flanks Pyramid Mountain. The sites are in a thicker forest of large spruce similar to Quiniscoe. Some of the sites are located on a point overlooking the lake. The sites have framed earth tent pads but no tables or fire rings.
