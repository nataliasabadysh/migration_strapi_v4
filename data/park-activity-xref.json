The Bear Creek Canyon trail is a popular, more demanding hike offering spectacular views of the creek and the surrounding area. The trail leaves the parking lot and makes a loop of the canyon. Hikers can cross the creek on a footbridge to the north side of the canyon and begin their ascent of the slope. A sturdy staircase of milled lumber makes the climb a little easier and reduces impact on the plant life and soil structure. A viewpoint after the first flight of stairs offers a place to rest and look down at the creek.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The wide, hard-packed trail continues up the rim of the canyon with two more viewpoints perched on the edge of the canyon wall and hemmed in by chainlink fence. The view of the creek, as it meanders through the steep-walled canyon forming various ripples and small waterfalls, is fantastic. Gradually the trail levels out and then begins a descent to the creek. A pit toilet is located here. The trail follows the creek for a short distance before crossing to the south side.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The canyon forms a microclimate with noticeably different vegetation on the two sides of the creek. The slope on the north is dry with Ponderosa pine and bunches of grass while the cooler south side has Douglas fir and carpets of moss, evidence of more moisture and shade.

There is a gravel pullout off Fairview-White Lake Road with parking for a limited number of vehicles. An information shelter is at this site. The trail passes through a small grove of aspen as it heads southeast into the park following a chain of alkali ponds. The small pass runs between rock bluffs to the north and a treed ridge to the south and overlooks Mahoney Lake and the rugged, rocky terrain of the northern section of the protected area. The trail winds its way down to Mahoney Lake crossing a dam and entering open Ponderosa pine forest. Another small pond is passed and the trail becomes a dirt road. A branch of the road veers north and travels diagonally through the park roughly following Kearns Creek. This is a much longer route that should not be attempted unless prepared for a full day of hiking through dry, rugged terrain. The trail/road follows the western shore of Mahoney Lake and comes out at Green Lake Road on either end of the lake. Allow two hours to reach the gate and parking at the north end of Mahoney Lake. For a longer hike, the trail continues across Green Lake Road south of Mahoney Lake to the top of Mt. Keogan.\n</p>",

To complete this trip, you must have a vehicle at the Natadesleen Lake Trail pullout along Highway 37, or arrange with the Park Operator\n  <u></u>for a shuttle.\n</p>\n<p>\n  From the Kinaskan Lake boat launch, paddle west along the shoreline until you reach the Iskut River. Navigate the Iskut River downstream until you reach Natadesleen Lake. Once you reach Natadesleen Lake, you may choose to access the Lower Cascade Falls Trail or take out at the Natadesleen Lake Trail and portage your vessel to Highway 37.\n</p>\n<p>\n  To access the Lower Cascade Falls Trail, continue paddling to the southwest side of the lake and look for the Lower Cascade Falls trailhead.\n</p>\n<p>\n  To access the Natadesleen Lake Trail (take out), paddle to the south east side of Natadesleen Lake and find the Natadesleen Lake Trail.

Most canoe parties plan to arrive at the campsite the night before in order to have an early morning departure.&nbsp;Morice Lake often has high winds and large waves making it dangerous for canoe parties.&nbsp; The safest time to paddle is early in the morning.&nbsp; From the campsite, the safest route is to follow the lakeshore to the north east and proceed around the head of the lake to reach the west shoreline. Proceed south west along the shoreline to reach Atna Bay. At the back end of Atna Bay, you will find the Atna River mouth.&nbsp; Proceed past the river mouth to the next small cove to find the portage trailhead.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  The first short portage (200m) is known as the “Corkscrew” as it winds around some old blow-down. After completing the portage, paddle upstream along the still pools of the lower Atna River to the waterfall and find the next portage to the right of the base of the falls. This portage is also short (200m), but the first portion around the falls is very steep. Paddle across the next pool of the Atna River to reach the final portage at the right side of the river outlet.

A short paddle across Lamprey Lake to the south shore brings you to the first portage (1.5 kilometres). All portages are marked with white triangles. This portage ascends gradually to an undulating ridge and then drops down to Anzac Lake. Canoe rests are located along the trail and boardwalk through the wet areas makes the trail easy to travel.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe next lake is Anzac Lake, which contains many water lily filled bays and an island with a good camping site. This doglegged lake is a great place for viewing birds and wildlife.\n<br>\n<br>\nA short portage trail (0.5 kilometres) from Anzac Lake leads to the east end of Stepp Lake. Head winds are often encountered upon reaching Stepp Lake. A campsite is provided nearby at the Anzac end of the portage trail. Stepp Lake has many bays and beaches to explore. Two campsites are located along the north shore of Stepp lake. It is possible to hike through the bush to Tableland Mountain from these campsites; however there are no trails maintained. On the return trip down Stepp Lake, it is often possible to rig your tent fly as a sail.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe west end of Stepp Lake is narrow and you must canoe through a couple of turns before arriving at a campsite and the portage to Kidprice Lake. This is the longest portage at 2.2 kilometres, and it travels over mostly level ground. Once Kidprice Lake is reached there is a great camping area at the end of the portage with a nice beach and sunset views of the snow-capped peaks. Breezes off the lake keep the bugs out of this campsite.\n<br>\n<br>\nFour kilometres up Kidprice Lake on the north shore, the lower Nanika River begins and a short distance down stream the river drops over the Nanika Falls. Beach your boat on the West side of the river mouth at the water metering station. A 500m trail leads down to the falls. Do not approach the falls by canoe as you may not be able to escape the strong current.\n<br>\n<br>\nSome canoeists continue down Kidprice Lake. There are beaches to camp on, but no maintained campsites are available. It is possible to access Nanika Lake by lining your canoe up the upper Nanika River; however this is a long (8 km) and arduous journey and log jams are often present.

Intensive use of confined campsites creates unsanitary conditions for park visitors.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <h6>\n      Bear/People Conflict Prevention\n    </h6>\n    Bear proof containers must be used for the transportation and storage of all food and garbage.\n    <br>\n    Report all aggressive or unusual bear behaviour and close bear-human interactions (\n    <em>\n      e.g.\n    </em>\n    , a bear in camp, bluff charge,\n    <em>\n      etc.\n    </em>\n    ) to the Babine Area Supervisor, 250-847-7565, as soon as possible.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <h6>\n      Fires\n    </h6>\n    All float trips are requested to use a fire pan. The creation of rock fire rings and the burning of wood on shore is strongly discouraged.\n    <br>\n    All surplus or charred firewood/residual ash should be carried out of the park or deposited in the river. No firewood should be left on shore.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <h6>\n      Wildlife\n    </h6>\n    <ol>\n      <li>\n        Any viewing of wildlife should be carried out in a discreet manner and from a distance that will not disturb the animal(s) being viewed.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Adhere to the\n        <a href=\"http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/wld/twg/\" target=\"_blank\">\n          Wildlife Guidlines</a>\n        when carrying out activities, except where an alternative strategy has been proposed.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Limit bear viewing at Grizzly Drop to 30 minutes above the rapid and 10 minutes below the rapid.\n      </li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h5>\n  Safety Information\n</h5>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Always be on the alert for a potential wrapper rock at the bottom of every drop - it is a good rule for the Babine River in general. Immediately past Gail Creek, you begin the class 4 section that takes you down to the Skeena River with 10 serious class 4 rapids and dozens of 3+ boulder drops. Please do not attempt to do this section of river in the absence of an experienced trip leader.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Support boats are recommended.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Trip leaders should preferably have previous experience on this river.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Kayakers should possess the skills to roll their boats in order to challenge this river.\n  </li>\n</ul>",

BC Parks encourages behaviour that will make this experience enjoyable for everyone:\n<ol start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\n  <li>\n    Give people space. When someone has a fish on, please reel in and give them room to land their fish. When arriving to fish beside someone, give them room to make safe casts.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Avoid monopolizing good pools for long periods. Give others a chance to get in and try out a productive pool.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Be courteous to others on shore. Be aware of people behind you when making your back cast.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Observe your quota. Please consult\n    <a href=\"/plan-your-trip/things-to-do/freshwater-fishing\">\n      fishing regulations and DFO</a>. The daily quota for sockeye salmon is posted by DFO.\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n  The experience at the Babine River is valued by many.

High elevation wetlands in the Upper Price Creek drainage are likely important for migratory waterfowl in spring and fall. Tailed frogs (blue-listed) have been found across the Skeena River from Oliver Creek, and may live in small tributaries within the protected area.

The shortest tour is not the easiest considering the narrow vertical-squeeze entrance, but the 1 hr Main Cave Adventure (age 5+) features rock scrambling and a ride down Canada’s only Cave Slide! The Multi-Cave Experience (age 8+) provides 3 hours of cave exploring that combines the best features and challenges for adventurous families and novice cave explorers including a climb up an underground waterfall! Those wanting maximum adventure can sign on to the Extreme Cave &amp; Rappel (age 13+), a five-hour excursion that has explorers rappel down a seven-storey waterfall that leads into the “China Shop Passage” to reach the very end of this amazing cave with a climb out on a cable ladder. Not for the faint of heart!

      "description": "<p>\n  There are opportunities to spelunk on the Stone Corral Trail. Small caves can be found in the limestone outcrops.\n</p>\n<p>\n  At the far end of the Stone Corral, beneath the steepest cliffs, lies the large entrance to Corral Cave. Although this cave is only 20 metres deep, it contains a number of fascinating features. The walls are smooth and vertical and the ceiling is high, making for an easy walk-in cave. The floor is rock-strewn, and there are a number of large perpetual drips. In spring and early summer the floor of the cave is a dramatic collection of large icicles. On the left wall, about halfway in, there is a small round hole. This is a typical phreatic tube. The initial dissolution process that widens the cracks underground occurs below the water table. Because of the very slow movement of the water and because it completely fills the crack, the result is a perfectly round tube. Later in the history of a cave when the water-table drops and air enters, if water is still passing through the crack it will selectively erode the bottom portion. The resulting V-shape is known as vadose, as opposed to the round phreatic features. At the end of the cave, if a flashlight is shone up into the top corner, there are a few tiny stalactites. Beyond these is a long descending tongue of a softer white substance, moonsmilk, an organic form of calcite. It is gooey when wet, with a texture like cottage cheese, but crumbly and powdery when dry. The origin of the name is traced to Europe, where the exact translation means “gnome’s milk”. It was used in medieval times as a wound dressing and recent research has shown the appropriateness of this remedy, as moonsmilk contains a number of substances with antibacterial properties. Overhead and along the wall there are also some beautiful calcite flowstone walls, as well as another attractive collection of small stalactites at the drip sites.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Another cave can be found along the trail as it leads away from the cliff-edge and crosses a gully. There is a tiny sinkhole with a small opening in the rock-face, this is one of the entrances of Porcupine Cave. Do not enter this opening! Instead, proceed and enter a second sinkhole just over the ridge, as the entrance to the cave from this aspect is larger. Porcupine Cave is 10 metres long, and joins the two sinkholes. It is a classic solutional feature created by the dissolving of limestone by slowly moving water. It is fairly narrow at either end but opens up into a chamber in the middle with standing room. There are fine coral fossils on the ceiling in this chamber. There is also cave popcorn, which is recognized by its knob-like shape, resulting from concentric layering of tiny calcite crystals. The floor of this cave is covered with old porcupine droppings, hence the name.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Caves are fragile environments that need to be treated with the greatest respect. Under no circumstances should you touch the walls, take anything or leave anything.</strong>\n</p>",

In 1968, one year before the establishment of the park, the Bugaboo Lodge was constructed on the site of the logging camp and since then it has earned a reputation as one of the premier helicopter skiing destinations worldwide.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The park is also renowned as a fantastic destination for self-propelled ski mountaineers. There are many classic ski tours that can be completed for parties based out of the Kain Hut basin, and the park is the starting point for the Bugaboos to Rogers Pass high-level ski traverse. Anyone considering visiting the park in the winter should be aware that the terrain is predominantly high alpine and very complex, with few safe options when avalanche danger is elevated. Because the Conrad Kain Hut can be threatened by avalanches, it is closed from November 16 to April 30 each year. Ski touring parties wishing to base camp in the vicinity of the main Bugaboo Spires (Bugaboo, Snowpatch, Pigeon etc) are required to stay at Applebee Dome campground where toilet facilities are located.\n</p>",

Fees go towards grooming the trail(s), maintaining emergency shelters, providing insurance and promoting avalanche awareness.

Sir Alexander and there are many open ridges and meadows.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Areas open to snowmobiling are zoned as Nature Recreation Zones and snowmobiling is permitted during snowmobiling season from Dec 1st to April 15/30th each winter.\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"snowmobiling_zone.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"legacy-link\">\n      Snowmobile Area Map [PDF 7.7MB]\n    </a>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  Overnight snowmobile users are restricted to the cabin at Kakwa Lake and should be aware that cabins are being used by BC Parks staff regularly. Users must supply their own wood for fuel from\n  <strong>outside</strong>\n  of the park. Snowmobile tent camps are not permitted in Kakwa Provincial Park.\n</p>\n<p>\n  There is no public access road into the park. In B.C., the Walker Creek Forest Road from Highway 16 currently provides access to the Bastille River at km 75, Bastille River is 10 km away from the park boundary. From Grand Prairie, the 112 km Kakwa River Forestry Road leads to the eastern boundary of Alberta’s Kakwa Wildland Park. Both approaches require long trips with no facilities and are only recommended for the most experienced snowmobilers. The role of the Kakwa Management Plan is to ensure that legitimate wilderness recreational snowmobiling occurs.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Avalanche training is strongly recommended for any winter recreational activities in the park. If you plan to snowmobile in Kakwa Provincial Park you need to be prepared with emergency equipment as it is an isolated area and distances are great.\n</p>",

Trail starts approximately 1/2 km from the campground area where there is parking for 6 or 7 vehicles on a gravel pullout just past the octagonal dairy barn. The trail follows the fenced corral to enter the canyon behind the old bunkhouse building. A staircase of milled lumber climbs steep north side of the canyon. The staircase has handrails and another rail at knee level.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Children must be accompanied by an adult. After the first flight of stairs, the trail levels out to an area perched on the edge of the canyon opposite the base of the waterfall and fenced in by a chain link fence. The area offers a stunning view of the two-tiered cascade and the steep canyon walls. The stairs continue up to a series of three wooden viewing platforms each offering a slightly different view of the falls as the stairs climb higher up the canyon wall. The third, and largest platform, offers the best view looking both down on the falls and the other platforms, and upstream to a corner where the canyon narrows and a pool forms.\n</p>\n<p>\n  There are fantastic views of Okanagan Lake and the Fintry Delta. Saskatoon bushes cling to life on the edge of the canyon beside the platform which has a small triangular bench. Above this are the remnants of the irrigation system. There is no designated trail beyond the chain link fence that blocks off access to the irrigation system. For your own safety and the preservation of the park, obey posted signs and keep to designated trails away from the steep cliffs of the canyon. Shortcutting trails destroys plant life and soil structure.\n</p>",

The Kermode bear (\n  <em>\n    Ursus americanus kermodei\n  </em>\n  ), also known as the “Spirit Bear”, is a subspecies of the American black bear living in the central and north coast of British Columbia and noted for about 1/10 of their population having white or cream-colored fur. This colour variant is due to a unique recessive trait in their gene pool – they are neither albino nor related to polar bears. The Kermode bear was named after Francis Kermode, former director of the Royal B.C. Museum who researched the species.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Because of their ghost-like appearance, “Spirit Bear” hold a prominent place in the First Nations mythology of the area and is known to them as Moksgm’ol. During the February 2006 Throne Speech by the Government of British Columbia, the Kermode bear was designated as British Columbia’s official mammal.\n</p>",

Wolverines are little known and rarely seen predators living in and suspected to be breeding in this area. In the low elevation forested area, marten and fisher (blue-listed) use the older forests, while moose, mule deer, coyotes and wolves tend to use the area around natural openings, burned areas and old cut blocks. The low elevation forest between Hell’s Bells Creek and Oliver Creek provides mule deer winter range. High elevation wetlands in the Upper Price Creek drainage are likely important for migratory waterfowl in spring and fall. Tailed frogs (blue-listed) have been found across the Skeena River from Oliver Creek, and may live in small tributaries within the Protected Area. High breeding populations of rough-skinned newts live in small ponds near Coyote Creek at the northern extent of their range.
